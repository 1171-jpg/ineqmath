Problem: Find the smallest constant $C$ such that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, the following inequality holds:
$$
x^2 + x + y^2 + y + C \geq x y
$$

Solution:

## Response

To find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
x^2 + x + y^2 + y + C \geq xy
\]

holds for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we can start by rearranging the inequality:

\[
x^2 - xy + y^2 + x + y + C \geq 0.
\]

This is a quadratic inequality in \( x \). We can denote the expression as:

\[
f(x) = x^2 - xy + y^2 + x + y + C.
\]

We need to find the minimum value of \( f(x) \) for all \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Conditions for a Quadratic to be Non-Negative
The expression \( f(x) \) should be non-negative for all \( x \). For a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \) to be non-negative for all \( x \), the following conditions must hold:
1. \( a \geq 0 \) (the coefficient of \( x^2 \) must be non-negative)
2. The discriminant must be less than or equal to zero.

### Step 2: Analyze the Coefficients
From \( f(x) = x^2 + (1-y)x + (y^2 + y + C) \):

- The coefficient \( a = 1 \), which is \( > 0 \).
- The discriminant \( D \) of the quadratic is given by:

\[
D = (1-y)^2 - 4(0)(y^2 + y + C)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
D = (1-y)^2 - 4(y^2 + y + C).
\]

### Step 3: Find the Minimum for the Discriminant to be Non-Positive
For \( f(x) \) to be non-negative for all \( x \), we require:

\[
(1-y)^2 - 4(y^2 + y + C) \leq 0.
\]

Solving this inequality for \( C \):

1. Expand the discriminant:

\[
1 - 2y + y^2 - 4y^2 - 4y - 4C \leq 0,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
1 - 5y^2 - 6y - 4C \leq 0.
\]

2. Rearranging gives:

\[
5y^2 + 6y + (4C - 1) \geq 0.
\]

### Step 4: Conditions for Non-Negative Quadratic
For \( 5y^2 + 6y + (4C - 1) \) to be non-negative for all \( y \), its discriminant must also be non-positive:

\[
6^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot (4C - 1) \leq 0,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
36 - 20(4C - 1) \leq 0.
\]

### Step 5: Solve for C
Simplifying this inequality:

\[
36 - 80C + 20 \leq 0 \\
56 \leq 80C \\
C \geq \frac{56}{80} = \frac{7}{10} = 0.7.
\]

### Final Result
Since we are looking for the smallest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality, we conclude:

\[
C = 0.7.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

```
The answer is $C=0.7$
