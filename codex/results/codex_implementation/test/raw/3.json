    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the condition given by \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(ab + ac + bc) \\). This indicates a certain relationship among \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n### Step 1: Simplifying the Condition\n\nWe rewrite the condition as follows:\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left((a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2\\right) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, we conclude that \\( a = b = c \\).\n\n### Step 2: Substituting into the Inequality\n\nAssuming \\( a = b = c \\) (let \\( a = b = c = k \\) for some non-zero \\( k \\)), we substitute into the inequality:\n\n\\[\n(3k)\\left(\\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k}\\right) \\geq C\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3k \\cdot \\frac{3}{k} = 9\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Finding \\( C \\)\n\nFrom our derivations, we observe that for \\( a = b = c \\):\n\n\\[\n9 \\geq C\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all \\( a, b, c \\) satisfying the original condition is:\n\n\\[\nC = 9\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHence, we summarize our findings:\n\nThe answer is '\"'\"'The answer is $C=9$'\"'\"'.\n",
