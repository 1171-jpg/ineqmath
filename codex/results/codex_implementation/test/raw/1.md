Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the following inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \):

\[
\frac{a^3}{a^3 + abc + b^3} + \frac{b^3}{b^3 + abc + c^3} + \frac{c^3}{c^3 + abc + a^3} \geq C.
\]

### Step 1: Analyzing the Expression
We can analyze each term in the sum. Notice that all the terms \( a, b, c \) are positive. Let's denote:

- \( x = a^3 \)
- \( y = b^3 \)
- \( z = c^3 \)

Then, the inequality can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{x}{x + xyz^{1/3} + y} + \frac{y}{y + xyz^{1/3} + z} + \frac{z}{z + xyz^{1/3} + x} \geq C.
\]

### Step 2: Boundary Cases
Next, we can explore some boundary cases to find a plausible value for \( C \).

1. **Case where \( a = b = c \)**:
    If \( a = b = c \), then we can simplify:

\[
\frac{a^3}{a^3 + a^3 + a^3} + \frac{a^3}{a^3 + a^3 + a^3} + \frac{a^3}{a^3 + a^3 + a^3} = 3 \cdot \frac{a^3}{3a^3} = 1.
\]

Thus, \( C \leq 1 \).

2. **Case where one variable is dominant**:
   If for instance \( a \gg b, c \), then:

\[
\frac{a^3}{a^3 + 0 + 0} + \frac{b^3}{0 + 0 + b^3} + \frac{c^3}{0 + 0 + c^3} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
\]

Again, this suggests \( C \leq 1 \).

### Step 3: Verifying Achievability
Let’s explore if \( C = 1 \) can be achieved for all positive \( a, b, c \):

Starting with the original inequality:

\[
\frac{a^3}{a^3 + abc + b^3} + \frac{b^3}{b^3 + abc + c^3} + \frac{c^3}{c^3 + abc + a^3} \geq 1.
\]

Using Titu's lemma (also known as Cauchy-Schwarz inequality):

\[
\frac{a^3}{a^3 + abc + b^3} + \frac{b^3}{b^3 + abc + c^3} + \frac{c^3}{c^3 + abc + a^3} \geq \frac{(a^3 + b^3 + c^3)^2}{(a^3 + abc + b^3) + (b^3 + abc + c^3) + (c^3 + abc + a^3)}.
\]

### Step 4: Simplifying the Denominator
Calculating the denominator:

\[
= (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 3abc.
\]

Since by AM-GM inequality, we know:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \geq 3abc,
\]

and thus, the whole denominator is \( \geq 4abc \).

### Step 5: Final Verification
The inequality now shows that combining the aforementioned results leads to:

\[
\frac{(a^3 + b^3 + c^3)^2}{(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 3abc} \geq 1 \implies (a^3 + b^3 + c^3)^2 \geq 4abc(a^3 + b^3 + c^3).
\]

After considering the previous analyses and scenarios, we conclude:

Finally, we find that \( C \) cannot be greater than \( 1 \) and can actually reach it.

### Conclusion
Hence, the largest constant \( C \) for which the inequality holds is:

\[
\boxed{1}.
\]
