## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\frac{ab}{3a + 4b + 2c} + \frac{bc}{3b + 4c + 2a} + \frac{ca}{3c + 4a + 2b} \quad () \quad \frac{a+b+c}{9},
\]

let's denote:

- \( S = \frac{ab}{3a + 4b + 2c} + \frac{bc}{3b + 4c + 2a} + \frac{ca}{3c + 4a + 2b} \)
- \( T = \frac{a+b+c}{9} \)

We want to determine the relationship between \( S \) and \( T \).

### Step 1: Analyze Each Fraction

Each term of \( S \) is of the form:

\[
\frac{xy}{3x + 4y + 2z}
\]

for some permutation of \( (a, b, c) \). Now observe that \( 3a + 4b + 2c \) is larger than \( a + b + c \) since all coefficients are positive. Thus, we get:

\[
3a + 4b + 2c \geq a + b + c
\]

This leads to:

\[
\frac{xy}{3x + 4y + 2z} \leq \frac{xy}{x + y + z}
\]

### Step 2: Use Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we can derive that:

\[
S \leq \frac{(xy + xz + yz)^2}{(3a + 4b + 2c) + (3b + 4c + 2a) + (3c + 4a + 2b)}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify and Analyze Terms

The denominator simplifies to:

\[
(3a + 4b + 2c) + (3b + 4c + 2a) + (3c + 4a + 2b) = 9(a + b + c)
\]

### Step 4: Combine and Conclude

Thus, we have:

\[
S \leq \frac{a+b+c}{9}
\]

This implies:

\[
S \leq T
\]

### Final Result

Since \( S \leq \frac{a+b+c}{9} \) implies that \( S \) is less than or equal to \( T \), we conclude:

\[
\frac{ab}{3a + 4b + 2c} + \frac{bc}{3b + 4c + 2a} + \frac{ca}{3c + 4a + 2b} \leq \frac{a+b+c}{9}
\]

Therefore, the correct relationship to fill in the blank is:

'"'"'The answer is (A) $\leq$'"'"'.
