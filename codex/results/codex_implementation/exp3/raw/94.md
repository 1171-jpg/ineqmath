## Response

To solve the problem, let's analyze the given conditions and the inequality we need to determine.

We start with the condition:

\[
a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 10
\]

We need to analyze the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b}
\]

Let's define \( s = a + b \) and \( p = ab \). From the inequality \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), we know that:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \geq \frac{a + b}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Thus:

\[
s + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 10 \implies s + \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \leq 10
\]

Solving for \( s \):

\[
s \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \leq 10
\]

Let \( k = 1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \), then we have:

\[
s \leq \frac{10}{k} \approx 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} + 1} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{2} - 1)}{1} = 10(\sqrt{2} - 1)
\]

Now, since \( a \) and \( b \) are both positive, we can relate the harmonic mean \( H \) of \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
\frac{2}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}} \leq s \implies \frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq \frac{4}{s}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq \frac{4}{s}
\]

Now using:

\[
s \leq 10(\sqrt{2} - 1)
\]

This gives us:

\[
\frac{4}{s} \geq \frac{4}{10(\sqrt{2} - 1)} = \frac{2}{5(\sqrt{2} - 1)}
\]

To find out \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \), we need to evaluate:

1. When \( s \) is minimized at its maximum value of \( 10 \), it also implies:

   If \( a + b \) is approximately equal and maximizes at \( 10 \), it provides insight that \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \) would behave according to the increases in \( a \) and the decreasing \( b \).

Since there is an inherent lower bound that must be produced from the functions of \( a \) and \( b \), and how they oscillate with rerun of such classes, we conjecture to finalize the resulting inequality.

After careful consideration, we conclude:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \quad \geq \quad 1.
\]

Thus, filling in the blank with the appropriate symbol to reflect this relation:

**Final Answer:**

'''The answer is (B) $\geq$'''
