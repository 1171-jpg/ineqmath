## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition:

\[
a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 10.
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

First, rewrite the square root term:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq \sqrt{(a + b)^2} = a + b.
\]

Thus:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq a + b.
\]

So we can conclude:

\[
a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq a + b + (a + b) = 2(a + b).
\]

### Step 2: Combine inequalities

From our initial condition, we know:

\[
2(a + b) \leq 10 \implies a + b \leq 5.
\]

### Step 3: Examine the required inequality

We need to evaluate:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \quad \text{against} \quad 1.
\]

### Step 4: Apply a specific test case

Let's test specific values to assess the inequality:

1. Choose \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{1} + \frac{2}{1} = 3.
\]

This satisfies \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq 1\).

2. Choose \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{1} = 0.5 + 2 = 2.5.
\]

This also satisfies \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq 1\).

3. Choose \( a = 4 \) and \( b = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{1} = 0.25 + 2 = 2.25.
\]

Still satisfies the inequality.

### Step 5: Determine potential limits

Now, we can also check the lower bounds based on maximum \( a + b \). The limit of \( a + b \) is 5, suggesting we are getting close.

If we let \( a \) be very small (e.g., approaching zero), \(\frac{1}{a}\) will tend to infinity, thus:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \rightarrow \infty.
\]

Conversely, if \( b \) is very small, \(\frac{2}{b}\) also tends towards infinity.

### Conclusion from testing cases

Given various tests and maximizing \( a + b \) under the fixed constraint provided, we can stipulate that \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b}\) can get arbitrarily large but tends to stay above 1 when \( a \) and \( b \) are adjusted reasonably given \( a + b \leq 5\).

### Final Answer

Thus, the conclusion we draw from these derivations is:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq 1.
\]

Therefore, the blank can be filled with:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
