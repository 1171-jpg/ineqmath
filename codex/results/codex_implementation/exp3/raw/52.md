## Response

To solve the problem involving the inequality 

\[
\sqrt{a b c} + \sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \quad () \quad 1,
\]

where \( a, b, c \in (0,1) \), we will analyze two parts of the expression.

### Steps of the Solution:

1. **Understanding the Terms**:
   - The term \(\sqrt{abc}\) is the geometric mean of \( a, b, c \).
   - The term \(\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)}\) is the geometric mean of \( (1-a), (1-b), (1-c) \).

2. **Applying AM-GM Inequality**:
   - By the **Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM)** inequality, we know that for any non-negative numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\):

     \[
     \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}
     \]

   - Applying this to \( a, b, c \),
     \[
     \frac{a + b + c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc}.
     \]

   - Similarly,
     \[
     \frac{(1-a) + (1-b) + (1-c)}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)}.
     \]

3. **Boundaries**:
   - Since \( a, b, c \) lie in \( (0, 1) \), both \( \sqrt{abc} \) and \(\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)}\) are at most 1 because \( a, b, c < 1 \).
   - This implies that each geometric mean will contribute positively yet will be less than or equal to 1.

4. **Testing the Sum**:
   - The maximum possible value of \( \sqrt{abc} + \sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \) occurs when both terms are at their individual maximums simultaneously.
   - Since both terms can reach their peak values (1 when \( a, b, c \) are very close to 1, and 0 when \( 1-a, 1-b, 1-c \) are near zero), we can conclude that:

     \[
     \sqrt{abc} + \sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} < 2.
     \]

   - However, we need to check when this might approach or involve 1.

5. **Evaluating Specific Cases**:
   - Let’s consider \( a = b = c = 0.5 \):
     \[
     \sqrt{0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5} + \sqrt{(1-0.5)(1-0.5)(1-0.5)} = \sqrt{0.125} + \sqrt{0.125} = 2 \cdot \sqrt{0.125} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707 < 1.
     \]

6. **Final Evaluation**:
   - The inequality must hold true for the cases in which both \(\sqrt{abc}\) and \(\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)}\) cannot individually reach one without exceeding it, leading us to conclude that it indeed holds less than 1 under the provided constraints.

### Conclusion:
Thus, we conclude that the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is 

\[
\sqrt{abc} + \sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \leq 1.
\]

Therefore, the answer is 

'"'The answer is (A) $\leq$'"'
