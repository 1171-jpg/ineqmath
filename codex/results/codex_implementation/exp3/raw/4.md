Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we start from the condition given:

Let \( a, b, c > 0 \) with the constraint:

\[
a + b + c = abc.
\]

We aim to find the largest constant \( C \) such that:

\[
\frac{a}{b^3} + \frac{b}{c^3} + \frac{c}{a^3} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive \( a, b, \) and \( c \) satisfying this condition.

### Step 1: Normalize the Variables

To simplify the analysis, we can use the transformation given by:

\[
a = \frac{x}{y}, \quad b = \frac{y}{z}, \quad c = \frac{z}{x}
\]

This implies:

\[
a + b + c = \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{z} + \frac{z}{x}.
\]

### Step 2: Applying AM-GM Inequality

We apply the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality to \( a + b + c \):

\[
a + b + c \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{abc}.
\]

However, we also know:

\[
abc = \frac{x}{y} \cdot \frac{y}{z} \cdot \frac{z}{x} = 1.
\]

Thus,

\[
a + b + c = abc \implies a + b + c = 3 \sqrt[3]{abc} = 3.
\]

### Step 3: Determine Lower Bound for Expression

Now, consider the expression:

\[
\frac{a}{b^3} + \frac{b}{c^3} + \frac{c}{a^3}.
\]

By AM-GM again, we have:

\[
\frac{a}{b^3} + \frac{b}{c^3} + \frac{c}{a^3} \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{a}{b^3} \cdot \frac{b}{c^3} \cdot \frac{c}{a^3}}.
\]

Calculating the product inside the cubic root:

\[
\frac{a}{b^3} \cdot \frac{b}{c^3} \cdot \frac{c}{a^3} = \frac{abc}{b^3c^3a^3} = \frac{abc}{(abc)^{3/2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(abc)^3}} = 1.
\]

Thus,

\[
\sqrt[3]{\frac{a}{b^3} \cdot \frac{b}{c^3} \cdot \frac{c}{a^3}} = 1 \implies 3 \geq 3\sqrt[3]{1} = 3.
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion on Bound \( C \)

This implies that the minimum value for the inequality is \( 3 \). Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{a}{b^3} + \frac{b}{c^3} + \frac{c}{a^3} \geq 3.
\]

Hence, we conclude that the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a + b + c = abc \) is:

\[
C = 3.
\]

#### Final Statement

The answer is 

```
'The answer is $C=3$'
