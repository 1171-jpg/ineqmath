## Response

To solve the problem, we'll analyze the given expression and inequality step by step, applying mathematical principles to derive the result.

1. **Understanding the Equation**:
   We start with the given equation:
   \[
   c^2 + d^2 = (a^2 + b^2)^3
   \]
   This suggests a relationship between the variables \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\).

2. **Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**:
   We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to express the relationship:
   \[
   (c^2 + d^2)(\frac{a^4}{c^2} + \frac{b^4}{d^2}) \geq (a^2 + b^2)^2
   \]
   This rearrangement implies:
   \[
   c^2 + d^2 \geq \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{\frac{a^4}{c^2} + \frac{b^4}{d^2}}
   \]

3. **Setting the Stage**:
   Given \(c^2 + d^2 = (a^2 + b^2)^3\), we substitute this into the inequality:
   \[
   (a^2 + b^2)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{a^4}{c^2} + \frac{b^4}{d^2}\right) \geq (a^2 + b^2)^2
   \]
   Rearranging gives us:
   \[
   \frac{a^4}{c^2} + \frac{b^4}{d^2} \geq \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{(a^2 + b^2)^3} = \frac{1}{a^2 + b^2}
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   c^2 + d^2 \geq (c + d)^2
   \]

4. **Revisiting the Original Expression**:
   Now, consider the expression concerning the inequality we are examining:
   \[
   \frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d}
   \]
   Using Cauchy-Schwarz again:
   \[
   \left(\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d}\right)^2 \leq (a^2 + b^2) \left(\frac{a^4}{c^2} + \frac{b^4}{d^2}\right)
   \]
   Combining this with the previous findings leads us to show that:
   \[
   \frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \leq (c^2 + d^2)
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   The inequality that best fills the gap in the original inequality is:
   \[
   \frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \leq 1
   \]

Thus, the correct answer corresponding to the options given in the problem is:
```plaintext
'The answer is (A) $\leq$'
