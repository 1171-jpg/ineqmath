## Response

To solve the problem, we start from the given condition:

\[
c^2 + d^2 = (a^2 + b^2)^3.
\]

We need to analyze the expression:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d}.
\]

### Step 1: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[
(c^2 + d^2) \left( \frac{a^6}{c^2} + \frac{b^6}{d^2} \right) \geq \left( a^3 + b^3 \right)^2.
\]

Substituting \( c^2 + d^2 \) from the problem statement, we get:

\[
(a^2 + b^2)^3 \left( \frac{a^6}{c^2} + \frac{b^6}{d^2} \right) \geq (a^3 + b^3)^2.
\]

### Step 2: Relate to Our Expression

Now, we want to relate this to our expression \( \frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \).

By Cauchy-Schwarz in a different form, we can also consider:

\[
(c + d) \left( \frac{a^6}{c^3} + \frac{b^6}{d^3} \right) \geq (a^3 + b^3)^2.
\]

However, we are primarily interested in how \( \frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \) behaves.

### Step 3: Applying AM-GM Inequality

Using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality:

\[
\frac{\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d}}{2} \geq \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{c} \cdot \frac{b^3}{d}}.
\]

Thus we find:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \geq 2 \sqrt{\frac{a^3 b^3}{cd}}.
\]

### Step 4: Verify Conditions

Now let's analyze the implications of this with respect to \( (a^2 + b^2)^3 \). We can derive that:

\[
cd \leq \frac{c^2 + d^2}{2} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^3}{2}.
\]

This implies \( \frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \) can be greater than or at least equal to \( 1 \).

### Step 5: Conclusion on Inequality

From our analysis and inequalities derived, we have:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \geq 1.
\]

Given the options, the only logical relation that is consistent with our derived inequality is:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \geq 1.
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the answer is:

''The answer is (B) $\geq$''
