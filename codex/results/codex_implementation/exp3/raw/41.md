Problem: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$:

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{a}{\sqrt{3a + 2b + c}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{3b + 2c + a}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{3c + 2a + b}} \leq C\sqrt{a + b + c}
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, \) and \( c \).

### Step 1: Setting normalization

Let \( S = a + b + c \). We will normalize \( a, b, c \) by defining \( a = Sx \), \( b = Sy \), \( c = Sz \) where \( x + y + z = 1 \) and \( x, y, z > 0 \). The inequality now transforms to:

\[
\frac{Sx}{\sqrt{3Sx + 2Sy + Sz}} + \frac{Sy}{\sqrt{3Sy + 2Sz + Sx}} + \frac{Sz}{\sqrt{3Sz + 2Sx + Sy}} \leq C\sqrt{S}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{\sqrt{3x + 2y + z}} + \frac{y}{\sqrt{3y + 2z + x}} + \frac{z}{\sqrt{3z + 2x + y}} \leq C
\]

### Step 2: Applying specific values

To find \( C \), let's test specific values for \( x, y, z \).

1. **Case 1: \( x = 1, y = 0, z = 0 \)** 
   \[
   LHS = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} 
   \]

   Thus, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \leq C \implies C \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
   \]

2. **Case 2: \( x = 0, y = 1, z = 0 \)** 
   \[
   LHS = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} 
   \]

   Thus, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \leq C \implies C \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
   \]

3. **Case 3: \( x = 0, y = 0, z = 1 \)** 
   \[
   LHS = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} 
   \]

   Thus, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \leq C \implies C \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
   \]

### Step 3: Symmetric case

Now, we explore the symmetric case where \( x = y = z = \frac{1}{3} \):

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}.
\]

Thus, 

\[
LHS = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

Hence, we have confirmed that:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \leq C \implies C \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

### Conclusion

We have seen that the left-hand side does not exceed \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \) under several configurations, suggesting that this is the correct bound.

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) satisfying the inequality for all positive \( a, b, c \) is 

\[
C = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

Therefore, the answer is 

```
'The answer is $C=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$'
