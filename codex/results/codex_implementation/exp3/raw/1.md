Problem: For $a, b, c > 0$, find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given inequality:

\[
\frac{a^3}{a^3 + abc + b^3} + \frac{b^3}{b^3 + abc + c^3} + \frac{c^3}{c^3 + abc + a^3} \geq C
\]

Let's define:

- \( x = \frac{a^3}{a^3 + abc + b^3} \)
- \( y = \frac{b^3}{b^3 + abc + c^3} \)
- \( z = \frac{c^3}{c^3 + abc + a^3} \)

We need to find a constant \( C \) such that \( x + y + z \geq C \) for all positive \( a, b, c \). 

### Step 1: Analyze individual fractions

Each term \( x, y, z \) can be interpreted as a fraction of one variable's cube relative to a polynomial in three variables. Notably:

\[
x + y + z \rightarrow \text{We will check if any symmetry or simplification can be used.}
\]

### Step 2: Test specific values

1. **Case 1: Set \( a = b = c = 1 \)**

   This gives:
   \[
   x = \frac{1^3}{1^3 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + 1^3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   Therefore, for this case:
   \[
   x + y + z = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 1
   \]

2. **Case 2: Set \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 0 \)** and let \( c \to 0 \)

   This would give:
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{1 + 0 + 1} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{1}{1 + 0 + 0} = 1, \quad z = 0
   \]
   Hence:
   \[
   x + y + z = \frac{1}{2} + 1 + 0 = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   This suggests that the lower bound might be at least 1.

### Step 3: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the terms could also be beneficial:

By applying Cauchy-Schwarz to each term, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{a^3}{a^3 + abc + b^3} + \frac{b^3}{b^3 + abc + c^3} + \frac{c^3}{c^3 + abc + a^3} \right) \left( (a^3 + abc + b^3) + (b^3 + abc + c^3) + (c^3 + abc + a^3) \right) \geq (a^3 + b^3 + c^3)^2
\]

From analysis, it seems like the terms do not go below 1 under various substitutions, reinforcing that:

### Conclusion

Through exploration and testing values, we find that the lower bound evidenced remains:

\[
C = 1
\]

Thus, we can conclude that:

The answer is $C=1$
