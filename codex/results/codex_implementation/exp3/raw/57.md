## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\sum_{cyc} \sqrt{\frac{a+b}{b^2+4bc+c^2}} \quad () \quad \frac{2}{\sqrt{a+2b+4c}},
\]

we need to analyze both sides of the inequality.

### Step 1: Understand the cyclic sum

The expression \(\sum_{cyc} \sqrt{\frac{a+b}{b^2+4bc+c^2}}\) refers to the cyclic sum over the permutations of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). This means:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a+b}{b^2+4bc+c^2}} + \sqrt{\frac{b+c}{c^2+4ca+a^2}} + \sqrt{\frac{c+a}{a^2+4ab+b^2}}.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the right side

The right-hand side is:

\[
\frac{2}{\sqrt{a + 2b + 4c}}.
\]

This represents a decreasing function with respect to \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) since increasing \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) will increase \(a + 2b + 4c\), thus decreasing the entire expression.

### Step 3: Consider specific cases

Let’s evaluate this inequality for specific cases of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). 

1. **Case 1**: Let \(a = b = c = 1\):

\[
\sum_{cyc} \sqrt{\frac{1+1}{1^2 + 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + 1^2}} = 3 \sqrt{\frac{2}{6}} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{3}.
\]

And on the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{2}{\sqrt{1 + 2 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 1}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Now we need to check whether \(\sqrt{3} \quad () \quad \frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}\).

Calculating approximate values:

\(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\) and \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{7}} \approx 0.755\). So, we find that 

\(\sqrt{3} > \frac{2}{\sqrt{7}}\).

### Step 4: Generalize the inequality

Since we found one case where the left-hand side exceeds the right-hand side, we need to analyze whether this holds generally. Notice that as \(c\) increases, since \(c\) appears more significantly in the denominators of the left-hand cycle terms, it will push down the left-hand side values.

We try a few more edge cases to generalize:

2. **Case 2**: Let \(a = 0\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 1\) (like extreme ratios). The left-hand side becomes 

\(\sum_{cyc} \sqrt{\frac{0 + 0}{0 + 0 + 1}} = 0.\)

And the right-hand side becomes 

\(\frac{2}{\sqrt{0 + 0 + 4}} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\). 

Here \(0 < 1\).

### Step 5: Conclusion

From the two cases:
- Case 1 ( \(1, 1, 1\) ) shows \(>.\)
- Case 2 ( \(0, 0, 1\) ) shows \(<.\)

This indicates the inequality is contingent on the specific values, however, as \(a, b, c\) tend to these extremes, the left tends to grow larger. Thus, we conclude:

The overall behavior is usually that:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \sqrt{\frac{a+b}{b^2+4bc+c^2}} \geq \frac{2}{\sqrt{a+2b+4c}}
\]

For general cases.

### Final Answer

Considering the options given, the correct relation is:
