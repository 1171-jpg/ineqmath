Problem: Let $a, b, c$ be real numbers such that $a^2 + bc = 1$. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{1}{a^2+1} + \frac{1}{b^2+1} + \frac{1}{c^2+1} \leq C
\]

holds for all real numbers \( a, b, c \) that satisfy the condition \( a^2 + bc = 1 \).

**Step 1: Analyze the given condition**

From the condition \( a^2 + bc = 1 \), we can express \( bc \) as:

\[
bc = 1 - a^2
\]

**Step 2: Calculate bounds for \( b \) and \( c \)**

Since \( b \) and \( c \) are real numbers, and knowing that \( a^2 \) is non-negative, it follows that \( bc \) can take values in the range determined by the values of \( a \).

**Step 3: Optimize the expression for \( C \)**

To find \( C \), we need to analyze the individual components in the inequality:

- \(\frac{1}{a^2 + 1}\): This value is maximized when \( a^2 \) is minimized. The smallest value of \( a^2 \) is 0, so:

\[
\frac{1}{a^2 + 1} \leq 1
\]

- \(\frac{1}{b^2 + 1}\) and \(\frac{1}{c^2 + 1}\): We must explore what happens to \( b^2 + 1 \) and \( c^2 + 1\) when \( b \) and \( c \) take values constrained by \( bc = 1 - a^2\).

**Step 4: Explore edge cases**

Let's evaluate edge cases by setting \( b = t \) and \( c = \frac{1 - a^2}{t} \):

\[
\frac{1}{b^2 + 1} + \frac{1}{c^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{t^2 + 1} + \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1 - a^2}{t}\right)^2 + 1}
\]

Using \( x = a^2 \):

Let us denote \( C = 1 + \frac{1}{t^2+1} + \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1 - x}{t}\right)^2 + 1} \) and manage to find the supremum.

**Step 5: Use inequalities**

To find bounds, we know from Cauchy-Schwarz or Jensen's inequality, individually and across terms:

1. For \( a, b, c \), we can assume \( b=c \) because of symmetry, set \( b^2 = c^2 = y\) giving us \( 2y = 1 - a^2 \).

We will equate proportionally and arrive at max \( C \).

**Step 6: Find the final compact format**

Given that's symmetrical and each contributes bound \( = 1 \rightarrow 3 \Rightarrow C \leq 3 \).

Analyzing leads to 

\[
C = 3
\]

Therefore,

\[
\frac{1}{a^2 + 1} + 2 \frac{1}{\frac{(1-a^2)^2}{y} + 1} \leq 3 \quad \forall a = b = c
\]

**Final Answer:**

The answer is \( C = 3 \).

```The answer is $C=3$```
