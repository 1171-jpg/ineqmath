## Response

To solve the problem of finding the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{\sqrt[3]{abc}}+\frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} \geq C
\]

holds for all \( a, b, c > 0 \), we can proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Analyzing the First Term

Using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, we know:

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies a+b+c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{abc}
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{\sqrt[3]{abc}} \geq 3
\]

### Step 2: Analyzing the Second Term

Now we need to consider the second term:

\[
\frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}
\]

Using the identity for symmetric sums, we can also relate \( (a+b), (b+c), (c+a) \) to the others. By AM-GM on the pairs:

\[
a+b \geq 2\sqrt{ab}, \quad b+c \geq 2\sqrt{bc}, \quad c+a \geq 2\sqrt{ca}
\]

So we derive:

\[
(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) \geq 8abc
\]

This leads to:

\[
\frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} \leq 1
\]

### Step 3: Combining the Inequalities

From our findings, we aggregate both inequalities:

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{\sqrt[3]{abc}} + \frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} \geq 3 + 1 = 4
\]

Thus, 

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{\sqrt[3]{abc}}+\frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} \geq 4
\]

### Step 4: Determining if \( C = 4 \) is Achievable

To check if \( C = 4 \) can be achieved, we can set \( a = b = c \):
Let \( a = b = c = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1+1+1}{\sqrt[3]{1}} + \frac{8(1)(1)(1)}{(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)} = 3 + \frac{8}{8} = 3 + 1 = 4
\]

Thus, the equality holds, verifying that \( C = 4 \) is indeed achievable.

### Conclusion

Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c > 0 \) is 

\[
\boxed{4}
\]

Thus, we express the solution in the specified format:

```
The answer is $C=4$
