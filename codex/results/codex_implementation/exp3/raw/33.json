    "response": "To solve the problem, we start with the inequality we want to validate under the condition \\( abc = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Rewrite the inequality\n\nWe need to determine the largest constant \\( C \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} \\geq C\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Use the condition \\( abc = 1 \\)\n\nFrom the condition \\( abc = 1 \\), we can express \\( a, b, c \\) in terms of \\( x, y, z \\) where \\( a = \\frac{x}{y}, b = \\frac{y}{z}, c = \\frac{z}{x} \\). This maintains \\( abc = 1\\) as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{y}{x}, \\quad \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{z}{y}, \\quad \\frac{1}{c} = \\frac{x}{z}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Apply AM-GM inequality \n\nBy the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality (AM-GM), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{abc}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{1}} = 1\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} \\geq 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion about \\( C \\)\n\nThis shows that \\( C \\) can be at most 3. Next, we need to check if \\( C=3 \\) is the sharp constant.\n\n### Step 5: Case validation\n\nLet's consider \\( a = b = c \\). If we set \\( a = b = c = 1 \\) (since \\( abc = 1 \\)), then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} = \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1} = 3\n\\]\n\nSince we achieved equality here, this confirms that \\( C = 3 \\) holds.\n\n### Step 6: Final statement\n\nSince we cannot exceed the derived bound with other configurations of positive \\( a, b, c \\) while respecting \\( abc = 1 \\), we conclude:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The largest constant } C \\text{ satisfying the inequality for all } a, b, c \\text{ is } 3.\n\\]\n\nThus, we conclude the solution with the answer format specified:\n\n```\nThe answer is $C=3$\n```\n",
