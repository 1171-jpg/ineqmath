    "response": "To solve the problem, we start with the condition \\( a + b + c = abc \\). This implies a relationship between the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) that will help us determine the value of \\(C\\) for which the inequality holds.\n\n1. **Finding bounds for the variables**:\n   - Using the fact that \\( a + b + c = abc \\) allows us to express one variable in terms of the others. Let's set \\( a = x \\), \\( b = y \\), and \\( c = z \\) for easier notation:\n     \\[\n     a + b + c = x + y + z = xyz.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Using AM-GM inequality**:\n   - From the inequality we need to prove:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x}{y^3} + \\frac{y}{z^3} + \\frac{z}{x^3} \\geq C,\n     \\]\n     we can apply the AM-GM inequality on the left-hand side:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x}{y^3} + \\frac{y}{z^3} + \\frac{z}{x^3} \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{xyz}{(y^3)(z^3)(x^3)}} = 3 \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{xyz}}{(xyz)^{3/3}} = 3 \\frac{1}{(xyz)^{2/3}}.\n     \\]\n3. **Replacing \\(xyz\\)**:\n   - Substituting \\(xyz = x + y + z\\) based on the condition:\n     \\[\n     = 3 \\frac{1}{(x + y + z)^{2/3}}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Using specific values**:\n   - We test the case where \\( a = b = c = t \\) (i.e., when all are equal):\n     \\[\n     t + t + t = t^3 \\implies 3t = t^3 \\implies t^3 - 3t = 0 \\implies t(t^2 - 3) = 0 \\implies t = \\sqrt{3}.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the inequality turns into:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{(\\sqrt{3})^3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{(\\sqrt{3})^3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{(\\sqrt{3})^3} =  \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determining \\(C\\)**:\n   - From testing with equal values, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{3} \\geq C.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the largest constant satisfying the inequality for all positive values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n     \\[\n     C = 1.\n     \\]\n\nThus, we conclude that:\n\n```\nThe answer is $C=1$.\n```\n",
