## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\frac{x^2 - y^2}{2x^2 + 1} + \frac{y^2 - z^2}{2y^2 + 1} + \frac{z^2 - x^2}{2z^2 + 1} \quad () \quad 0,
\]

we can analyze each term in the expression and use inequalities to derive the overall result.

### Step 1: Analyze Each Term

Each term has the form 

\[
\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a^2 + 1} = \frac{(a-b)(a+b)}{2a^2 + 1}.
\]

### Step 2: Identify Properties 

1. **Individual Terms**: For the first term:

   \[
   \frac{x^2 - y^2}{2x^2 + 1} \text{ can be positive or negative depending on } x^2 \text{ and } y^2.
   \]

2. **Boundaries**: We can observe the denominators \(2x^2 + 1\) are always positive since \(x^2\) is non-negative. This leads to the conclusion that the sign of each term depends on the sign of the numerator (i.e., \(x^2 - y^2\), etc.).

### Step 3: Symmetry and Balance

When summing these three terms, notice:
- It represents a relationship where \(x^2\), \(y^2\), and \(z^2\) can be compared cyclically.

### Step 4: Set Up a Testing Case

To check whether the conclusion can yield a valid inequality, consider a few test cases:

1. **Case 1**: Let \(x = y = z = 1\):
   \[
   \frac{1^2 - 1^2}{2 \cdot 1^2 + 1} + \frac{1^2 - 1^2}{2 \cdot 1^2 + 1} + \frac{1^2 - 1^2}{2 \cdot 1^2 + 1} = 0.
   \]

2. **Case 2**: Let \(x = 1\), \(y = 0\), \(z = 0\):
   \[
   \frac{1^2 - 0^2}{2 \cdot 1^2 + 1} + \frac{0^2 - 0^2}{2 \cdot 0^2 + 1} + \frac{0^2 - 1^2}{2 \cdot 0^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3} + 0 - 1 = -\frac{2}{3} < 0.
   \]

3. **Case 3**: Let \(x = 0\), \(y = 1\), \(z = 1\):
   \[
   \frac{0^2 - 1^2}{2 \cdot 0^2 + 1} + \frac{1^2 - 1^2}{2 \cdot 1^2 + 1} + \frac{1^2 - 0^2}{2 \cdot 1^2 + 1} = -1 + 0 + \frac{1}{3} = -\frac{2}{3} < 0.
   \]

### Step 5: Conclusion

Given the trials, we see that the sum can be both positive and negative depending on the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), but crucially, there exist cases where the expression evaluates to less than zero.

Thus, the correct relation to fill in is:

\[
\boxed{\leq}
\]

Final statement:
```
The answer is (A) $\leq$
```
