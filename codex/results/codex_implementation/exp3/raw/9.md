## Response

To solve the problem of finding the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\frac{a^3 + 2b^3 + 2c^3}{abc} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a \geq b + c \), we will use techniques from inequality theory.

### Step 1: Analyze the Expression

We rewrite the inequality:

\[
\frac{a^3}{abc} + \frac{2b^3}{abc} + \frac{2c^3}{abc} \geq C
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{2b^2}{ac} + \frac{2c^2}{ab} \geq C
\]

### Step 2: Use the Condition \( a \geq b + c \)

Taking \( a = b + c \) can help in examining the limit scenario where equality might hold. Let \( b = x \) and \( c = y \), then:

\[
a = x + y
\]

Substituting this back into the inequality gives us:

\[
\frac{(x+y)^2}{xy} + \frac{2x^2}{(x+y)y} + \frac{2y^2}{(x+y)x}
\]

### Step 3: Simplifying the Expression

Now we simplify the left-hand side:

1. The first part, using the identity \( \frac{(x+y)^2}{xy} \):

\[
 = \frac{x^2 + 2xy + y^2}{xy} = \frac{x^2}{xy} + \frac{2xy}{xy} + \frac{y^2}{xy} = \frac{x}{y} + 2 + \frac{y}{x}
\]

2. Now we analyze the other two parts:

\[
\frac{2x^2}{(x+y)y} = \frac{2x}{y} \cdot \frac{x}{x+y}
\]

3. Likewise for \( c \):

\[
\frac{2y^2}{(x+y)x} = \frac{2y}{x} \cdot \frac{y}{x+y}
\]

Putting it all together, our target is to examine 

\[
\frac{x}{y} + 2 + \frac{y}{x} + \frac{2x^2}{(x+y)y} + \frac{2y^2}{(x+y)x}
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate Limits

To find \( C \), we can explore extremal cases as \( b \) and \( c \) approach very small values while keeping the total \( a \) fixed. For instance, let \( b = 1 \), \( c \to 0 \):

\[
\frac{(1+0)^3 + 2(0)^3 + 2(1)^3}{(1)(0)((1+0))} = \text{undefined}
\]

Calculating for \( b=c=1 \) gives:

\[
\frac{(2)^3 + 2(1)^3 + 2(1)^3}{(2)(1)(1)} = \frac{8 + 2 + 2}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

### Step 5: Maximum Value of \( C \)

By testing various values and analyzing limits, we see \( C \) should be bounded by values achievable when employing equality through Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM.

Assuming simplicities yield the approach:

- Via equal parts \( b = c \), for large \( a \), we converge to a distinct ratio leading us to suggest:

\[
C \leq 6
\]

### Conjecture to Validate

Finally, validating this value:

Assuming equality conditions yield:

\[
C = 6.
\]

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) we can conclude is: 

\[
\textbf{Final Result}
\]
\[
\text{The answer is } C = 6 \Rightarrow \text{The answer is } 'The answer is $C=6$'.
