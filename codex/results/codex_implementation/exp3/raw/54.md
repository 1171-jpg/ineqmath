## Response

To solve the problem, we start from the given condition:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} = \sqrt{abc}
\]

We can rewrite this as:

\[
\frac{bc + ac + ab}{abc} = \sqrt{abc}
\]

This implies:

\[
bc + ac + ab = abc \cdot \sqrt{abc}
\]

Now we'll analyze the inequality we need to fill in:

\[
abc \quad () \quad \sqrt{3(a+b+c)}
\]

Using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality:

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(3\) gives:

\[
a+b+c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{abc}
\]

Thus, we can express \(abc\) in terms of \(3\):

\[
\sqrt{3(a+b+c)} \geq \sqrt{3 \cdot 3\sqrt[3]{abc}} = \sqrt{9\sqrt[3]{abc}} = 3 \sqrt[6]{abc}
\]

Let's analyze the situation:

1. If we multiply both sides by \(abc\):

   \[
   (abc)^2 \quad () \quad 3abc\sqrt[6]{abc}
   \]

2. If we compare both sides considering the AM-GM conditions, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality also can be applied for:

   \[
   (a+b+c)(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}) \geq (1 + 1 + 1)^2 = 9
   \]

   This indicates that \(abc\) should indeed relate back to \(3(a+b+c)\).

Given these manipulations and considering the equality case derived from symmetric settings, we reflect:

- \(abc\) can be as large as \(\sqrt{3(a+b+c)}\) but should not exceed \( \sqrt{3(a+b+c)}\) given the scenario, thus implying:

\[
abc \leq \sqrt{3(a+b+c)}
\]

Finally, it stands clear that:

\[
\text{The answer is (A) } \leq
\]

So, the final answer is:

'''The answer is (A) $\leq$'''
