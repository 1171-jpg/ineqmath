## Response

To solve the problem, we have the following conditions:

Given:
\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} = \sqrt{abc}
\]

We can rewrite this condition as:
\[
\frac{bc + ac + ab}{abc} = \sqrt{abc}
\]
Multiplying through by \(abc\), we have:
\[
bc + ac + ab = abc \cdot \sqrt{abc}
\]

Let's denote \(x = \sqrt{abc}\). Therefore, \(abc = x^2\) and we rewrite the condition:
\[
bc + ac + ab = x^3
\]

Now we need to determine the relationship between \(abc\) and \(\sqrt{3(a+b+c)}\).

### Step 1: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
We apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
\[
(a+b+c)\left(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}\right) \geq (1+1+1)^2 = 9
\]
Substituting the given condition, we have:
\[
(a+b+c)\sqrt{abc} \geq 9.
\]

### Step 2: Expressing \(abc\) in terms of \(a+b+c\)
From this inequality we can derive:
\[
\sqrt{abc} \geq \frac{9}{a+b+c}.
\]

#### Squaring both sides:
\[
abc \geq \frac{81}{(a+b+c)^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Determining upper limits
Using the AM-GM inequality:
\[
\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \Rightarrow a+b+c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{abc}.
\]

Squaring this gives:
\[
(a+b+c)^2 \geq 9\sqrt{abc}.
\]

### Step 4: Substituting back
We substitute \(abc = x^2\) into our inequality from Cauchy-Schwarz:
\[
x^2 \geq 3 \cdot \frac{81}{(3x)^{2}} = \frac{81}{3} = 27 \Rightarrow x^2 \geq 27 \Rightarrow abc \geq 27.
\]

### Step 5: Comparing \(abc\) with \(\sqrt{3(a+b+c)}\)
Now, we analyze the inequality relation:
We have:
\[
abc \text{ and need to compare it to } \sqrt{3(a+b+c)}.
\]
From earlier, \(abc \geq 27\), and since \(x^2 = abc\), we can multiply:
\[
abc \geq 9 \cdot \sqrt{3}
\]
Given \(a, b, c > 0\), we typically realize:
\[
\sqrt{3(a+b+c)} \text{ achieves maximum at certain settings of } a, b, c.
\]

### Conclusion
Given all we have derived:

The relationship:
\[
abc \geq \sqrt{3(a+b+c)}
\]

Thus, the correct inequality to fill in is:
\[
\text{(B) } \geq
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
```plaintext
'The answer is (B) ≥'
```
