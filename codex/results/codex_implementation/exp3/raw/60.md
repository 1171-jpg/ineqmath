## Response

To solve the inequality problem:

We need to analyze the expression 
\[
\left(\frac{2x}{y}+3\right)\left(\frac{3y}{z}+1\right)\left(\frac{z}{x}+1\right)
\]
compared to 
\[
2 + \frac{2(x+y+z)}{\sqrt[3]{xyz}}.
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the Left Side

Let's break down the left side:
1. **First Factor:** \(\frac{2x}{y} + 3\)
   - This is always positive for positive \(x\) and \(y\).
   
2. **Second Factor:** \(\frac{3y}{z} + 1\)
   - Also always positive for positive \(y\) and \(z\).
  
3. **Third Factor:** \(\frac{z}{x} + 1\)
   - Again, always positive for positive \(z\) and \(x\).

Thus, the product is positive.

### Step 2: Simplify the Right Side

The right side can be expressed as:
\[
2 + \frac{2(x + y + z)}{\sqrt[3]{xyz}}.
\]
Using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality (AM-GM), we know:
\[
\frac{x + y + z}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz}.
\]
This implies:
\[
x + y + z \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{xyz}.
\]
Substituting this into the expression gives:
\[
\frac{2(x + y + z)}{\sqrt[3]{xyz}} \geq 6.
\]
Thus, the right-hand side becomes:
\[
2 + \frac{2(x+y+z)}{\sqrt[3]{xyz}} \geq 8.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the Left Side

Now, looking at the left-hand side, we can derive estimates:

1. **Estimate of each factor:** 
   - Setting \(x = y = z\), say \(x = k\), we can compute:
   \[
   \left(\frac{2k}{k}+3\right) \left(\frac{3k}{k}+1\right) \left(\frac{k}{k}+1\right) = (2 + 3)(3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 = 40.
   \]

This quick evaluation suggests that the left-hand side can vary but appears larger than the lower bound of the right-hand side (minimum of 8).

### Step 4: General Comparison

Comparing the minimum of the right side (which we found to be at least 8) with the evaluation for different \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) values on the left side leads us to possible outcomes of greater than or equal concerns.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Putting together our evaluations and theoretical deductions, we see that generally, since the left side with specific choices consistently provides results comfortably larger than \(8\) when plugging in and calculating the factors properly.

Hence, by concluding that:
\[
\left(\frac{2x}{y}+3\right)\left(\frac{3y}{z}+1\right)\left(\frac{z}{x}+1) \geq 8,
\]
and since it deviates upwards depending on \(x,y, z\), the correct inequality is:

\[
\left(\frac{2x}{y}+3\right)\left(\frac{3y}{z}+1\right)\left(\frac{z}{x}+1\right) \geq 2 + \frac{2(x+y+z)}{\sqrt[3]{xyz}}.
\]

Thus, the answer is:

'TThe answer is (B) ≥'
