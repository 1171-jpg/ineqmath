    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{a+b+3c}} + \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{c+b+3a}} + \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{a+c+3b}} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all non-negative \\( a, b, c \\) satisfying \\( ab + bc + ca = 1 \\).\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Understanding the Inequality**:\n   We need to analyze the expression on the left-hand side (LHS) and understand how it behaves under the constraints given by \\( ab + bc + ca = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Testing Edge Cases**:\n   Since we are dealing with non-negative real numbers, let's consider specific case scenarios where some variables are zero. \n\n   - **Case 1**: Let \\( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{0}{\\sqrt{1+0+0}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0+0+3 \\cdot 1}} + \\frac{0}{\\sqrt{1+0+0}} \\geq C\n     \\]\n     This simplifies to \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\geq C \\). Thus, \\( C \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\).\n\n   - **Case 2**: Let \\( a = b = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, c = 0 \\):\n     \\[ \n     \\frac{0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + 0}} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{0 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{0 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}}\n     \\]\n     Simplifying gives:\n     \\[\n     2 \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{2} = 1 \\geq C.\n     \\]\n     This shows \\( C \\leq 1 \\).\n\n3. **Finding the Bound**:\n   To find the maximum value of \\( C \\), we take the maximum from our cases:\n   - From Case 1: \\( C \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\)\n   - From Case 2: \\( C \\leq 1 \\)\n\n   The most restrictive condition is \\( C \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\).\n\n4. **Testing for Equality**:\n   Now we verify if \\( C = 1 \\) holds for all cases. If \\( C = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\) could be approached, we check if it is achievable. Given applications of Cauchy-Schwarz and additional conditions might indicate that as we push \\( a, b, c \\) towards boundaries, \\( C = 1 \\) is consistently met.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Throughout our exploration in bounding \\( C \\) via specific values and exploring limits, we find that:\n\n\\[\nC = 1\n\\]\n\nis indeed achievable through various boundaries of \\( ab + bc + ca = 1 \\) where appropriate values for \\( a, b, c \\) are consistently leading to meeting the inequality.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe answer is `'\"'The answer is $C=1$'\"'`.\n",
