## Response

To solve the inequality 
\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} \quad () \quad -3a + b + 7c,
\]
we will analyze the left-hand side and the right-hand side separately.

### Step 1: Analyzing the Left-Hand Side
We have:
\[
LHS = \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a}.
\]

### Step 2: Applying the AM-GM Inequality
We can use the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality to get an upper bound on each term. The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\):
\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \ldots x_n}.
\]

Applying AM-GM to each term, we get:
\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{a^2}{b} \cdot \frac{b^2}{c} \cdot \frac{4c^2}{a}}.
\]
Calculating the product:
\[
\frac{a^2}{b} \cdot \frac{b^2}{c} \cdot \frac{4c^2}{a} = \frac{4a^2b^2c^2}{abc} = 4abc.
\]
Thus,
\[
LHS \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{4abc}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyzing the Right-Hand Side
The right-hand side is:
\[
RHS = -3a + b + 7c.
\]

### Step 4: Setting Values for a, b, c
To check the relationship between \(LHS\) and \(RHS\), we can examine a particular case. Let's set \(a = b = c = 1\):
\[
LHS = \frac{1^2}{1} + \frac{1^2}{1} + \frac{4 \cdot 1^2}{1} = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.
\]
\[
RHS = -3(1) + 1 + 7(1) = -3 + 1 + 7 = 5.
\]
In this case, \(LHS = 6\) and \(RHS = 5\). Therefore:
\[
6 > 5.
\]
This suggests that:
\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} > -3a + b + 7c.
\]

### Step 5: Generalizing the Conclusion
To ensure this holds true for positive \(a, b, c\), we conjecture that:
\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} \geq -3a + b + 7c.
\]
Given that we have shown a case where the inequality holds, we can conclude it is indeed \(>\).

### Final Answer
Thus, we can fill the blank with:
```
'The answer is (E) >'
