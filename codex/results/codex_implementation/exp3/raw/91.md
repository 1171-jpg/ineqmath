## Response

To determine the correct inequality for the given problem involving an acute triangle \( ABC \), we will analyze both sides of the inequality step by step.

1. **Understanding the Triangle's Properties**: 
   Since \( ABC \) is an acute triangle, all angles \( A, B, C \) are less than \( 90^\circ \). This implies that the cosine of each angle is positive, i.e., \( \cos A, \cos B, \cos C > 0 \).

2. **Rewriting the Left Side**:
   The left side of the inequality is:
   \[
   L = \frac{\cos A}{\cos B \cos C} + \frac{\cos B}{\cos C \cos A} + \frac{\cos C}{\cos A \cos B}
   \]

3. **Rewriting the Right Side**:
   The right side of the inequality is:
   \[
   R = 3 \left(\frac{1}{1 + \cos A} + \frac{1}{1 + \cos B} + \frac{1}{1 + \cos C}\right)
   \]

4. **Analyzing the Right Side**:
   Each term \( \frac{1}{1 + \cos A} \) is positive and less than or equal to 1 since \( \cos A < 1 \). Thus,
   \[
   R < 3 \cdot 1 = 3
   \]
   Since each term in \( R \) decreases as \( \cos A \) increases, the sum is affected by the configuration of the triangle.

5. **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**:
   We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for comparison:
   \[
   \left( \frac{\cos A}{\cos B \cos C} + \frac{\cos B}{\cos C \cos A} + \frac{\cos C}{\cos A \cos B} \right) \left( \cos B \cos C + \cos C \cos A + \cos A \cos B \right) \geq (\cos A + \cos B + \cos C)^2
   \]

   Reorganizing gives us insight into the relationship between terms on both sides.

6. **Applying Known Inequalities**:
   We utilize the identity related to an acute triangle:
   \[
   \cos A + \cos B + \cos C < \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   and find relationships established through known inequalities (like Nesbitt Inequality) that apply to the terms involved.

7. **Conclusion through Testing Known Values**:
   By examining various configurations (e.g., isosceles, equilateral triangles) and applying inequalities repeatedly, we find:
   \[
   L \geq 3
   \]
   and for large angles close to \( 90^\circ \), \( R \) would diminish even more against \( L \). 

Based on all points analyzed and established properties and inequalities, we can conclude:
\[
\frac{\cos A}{\cos B \cos C} + \frac{\cos B}{\cos C \cos A} + \frac{\cos C}{\cos A \cos B} \geq 3 \left( \frac{1}{1 + \cos A} + \frac{1}{1 + \cos B} + \frac{1}{1 + \cos C} \right)
\]
Thus, the blank in the original inequality can correctly be filled with:

'"'"'The answer is (B) $\geq$'"'"'
