## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given expression and inequalities. We have:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2} \quad () \quad n^2 + n
\]

where \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n > 0\) and \(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1\).

**Step 1: Analyze the Expression**

The expression inside the summation can be rewritten as:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} + \frac{n}{1+x_i^2} \right)
\]

This separates into two components:

1. \( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} \)
2. \( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{1+x_i^2} \)

**Step 2: Estimate Each Component**

**Component 1: \( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} \)**

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{1+x_i^2} \right) \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{x_i \cdot \frac{1}{1+x_i^2}} \right)^2
\]

Since \( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1 \), we get:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{1+x_i^2} \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{x_i \cdot \frac{1}{1+x_i^2}} \right)^2
\]

**Component 2: \( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{1+x_i^2} \)**

This component can be estimated similarly, but we know that \(n\) terms are summed. Overall, this entire component does not exceed \(n\) times the maximum value from the range of \(x_i\).

**Step 3: Combine Both Components**

Combine both components. Since each \(x_i\) is positive and their sum equals 1, we can conclude that:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2} \geq n
\]

However, we need to evaluate how this summation relates to \(n^2 + n\). 

**Step 4: Compare with \(n^2 + n\)**

As \(n\) grows, we can analyze in more detail by substituting simple values or considering edge cases. Calculating for specific values reveals that, generally:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2}
\]

does not exceed \(n^2 + n\) considering all preceding inequalities and known bounds.

**Step 5: Final Decision on the Inequality**

Upon evaluating the components, we see that:

1. The sum tends to remain less than or equal to \(n^2 + n\).
2. There could be equality under specific configurations (e.g., uniform distribution of \(x_i\)).
  
Hence, we conclude:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2} \leq n^2 + n
\]

Thus, we fill the blank with option (A):
