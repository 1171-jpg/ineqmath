Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we'll investigate the inequality 

\[
a^5 + 16b^5 \quad () \quad \frac{1}{6}
\]

where \(a\) and \(b\) are non-negative real numbers such that \(a + b = 1\). 

### Step 1: Rewrite the expression

Use \(b = 1 - a\) to express everything in terms of \(a\):

\[
b = 1 - a \quad \Rightarrow \quad b^5 = (1 - a)^5
\]

Substituting \(b\) into the inequality yields:

\[
a^5 + 16(1 - a)^5 \quad () \quad \frac{1}{6}
\]

### Step 2: Define the function and find critical points

Define the function:

\[
f(a) = a^5 + 16(1 - a)^5
\]

Differentiating \(f\) to find local maximums or minimums:

\[
f'(a) = 5a^4 - 80(1 - a)^4
\]

### Step 3: Set the derivative to zero

Set \(f'(a) = 0\):

\[
5a^4 = 80(1 - a)^4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^4 = 16(1 - a)^4
\]

Taking the fourth root:

\[
a = 2(1 - a)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
a + 2a = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3a = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Consequently, 

\[
b = 1 - a = 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate \(f(a)\) at critical points and endpoints

Evaluate \(f(0)\):

\[
f(0) = 0^5 + 16(1)^5 = 16
\]

Evaluate \(f(1)\):

\[
f(1) = 1^5 + 16(0)^5 = 1
\]

Evaluate \(f\) at \(a = \frac{2}{3}\) (and \(b = \frac{1}{3}\)):

\[
f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5 + 16\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^5
\]

Calculating:

\[
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5 = \frac{32}{243}
\]
\[
16\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^5 = 16 \cdot \frac{1}{243} = \frac{16}{243}
\]
\[
f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{32 + 16}{243} = \frac{48}{243} = \frac{16}{81}
\]

Now to check if \(\frac{16}{81} \leq \frac{1}{6}\):

### Step 5: Compare \(\frac{16}{81}\) with \(\frac{1}{6}\)

Convert \(\frac{1}{6}\) to the same denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{13.5}{81} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{16}{81} > \frac{13.5}{81}
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the inequality holds:

\[
a^5 + 16b^5 > \frac{1}{6}
\]

Hence, the correct option is:
