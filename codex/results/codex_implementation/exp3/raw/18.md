Problem: Let $a, b, c, m, n$ be positive real numbers. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, m, n \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$:
$$
\frac{a^2}{b(m a+n b)}+\frac{b^2}{c(m b+n c)}+\frac{c^2}{a(m c+n a)} \geq \frac{C}{m+n}.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start by interpreting the given inequality:

\[
\frac{a^2}{b(m a+n b)}+\frac{b^2}{c(m b+n c)}+\frac{c^2}{a(m c+n a)} \geq \frac{C}{m+n}
\]

where \( a, b, c, m, n \) are positive real numbers, and we are to find the largest constant \( C \).

### Step 1: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We will apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the left-hand side of the inequality:

\[
\left( \frac{a^2}{b(m a+n b)} + \frac{b^2}{c(m b+n c)} + \frac{c^2}{a(m c+n a)} \right) \left( b(m a + n b) + c(m b + n c) + a(m c + n a) \right) \geq (a+b+c)^2
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Second Factor

Calculate the second factor:

\[
b(m a + n b) + c(m b + n c) + a(m c + n a) = bm a + bn b + cm b + cn c + am c + an a
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
= m(ab + bc + ca) + n(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)
\]

### Step 3: Substitute and Rearrange

We substitute this back into our application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[
\left( \frac{a^2}{b(m a+n b)} + \frac{b^2}{c(m b+n c)} + \frac{c^2}{a(m c+n a)} \right) \left( m(ab + bc + ca) + n(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \right) \geq (a+b+c)^2
\]

### Step 4: Estimate Individual Terms

We want to analyze the left-hand side and extract the bounds. To estimate:

- Assume \( a = b = c = 1 \):
\[
\frac{1^2}{1(m+n)} + \frac{1^2}{1(m+n)} + \frac{1^2}{1(m+n)} = \frac{3}{m+n}
\]

This yields for \( a = b = c = 1 \):
\[
\frac{3}{m+n} \geq \frac{C}{m+n} \implies C \leq 3
\]

### Step 5: Check Equality Cases

Equality occurs when \( a = b = c \), suggesting \(C = 3\) is the largest possible value.

### Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c, m, n \) is:

```
The answer is $C=3$
