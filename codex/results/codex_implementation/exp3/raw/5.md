## Response

To solve the problem, we'll begin by analyzing the given expression and the constraints on \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).

### Step 1: Applying the Constraints
Since \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are positive real numbers with the constraint \(x + y + z = 1\), we know that each of the variables is in the interval (0, 1).

### Step 2: Analyzing the Expression
We need to analyze the expression:
\[
\left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right)\left(y + \frac{1}{y}\right)\left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right).
\]
Each term \(x + \frac{1}{x}\) approaches infinity as \(x\) approaches 0 and has a minimum value of 2 when \(x = 1\) (this can be shown using calculus or algebraic manipulation).

### Step 3: Finding the Minimum Value
To determine the largest constant \(C\) such that the inequality holds for all valid \(x, y, z\), we will find the minimum of the product. 

By applying the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality:
\[
x + \frac{1}{x} \geq 2,
\]
we find:
\[
y + \frac{1}{y} \geq 2,
\]
\[
z + \frac{1}{z} \geq 2.
\]

Thus,
\[
\left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right)\left(y + \frac{1}{y}\right)\left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right) \geq 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8.
\]

### Step 4: Validity of the Bound
Now we will check if the achieved lower bound can be met:
Consider the case when \(x = y = z = \frac{1}{3}\):
\[
x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{3} + 3 = \frac{10}{3}.
\]
Therefore:
\[
\left(\frac{10}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{1000}{27}.
\]

Calculating this gives approximately:
\[
\frac{1000}{27} \approx 37.037.
\]
Thus, it helps to check if the product can yield values lower than 8. 

### Conclusion
The established bound from the AM-GM inequality yields consistently that the minimum value of the product is at least \(8\).

Thus, the largest constant \(C\) such that:
\[
(x + \frac{1}{x})(y + \frac{1}{y})(z + \frac{1}{z}) \geq C
\]
is:
\[
\boxed{8}.
\]

Therefore, we conclude:
```
'The answer is $C=8$'
