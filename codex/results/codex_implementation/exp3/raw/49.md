Problem: Let $p > q > 0$. Determine the largest constants $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$:
$$
\frac{p+q}{p-q} \geq C\frac{2(x^2-2 q x+p^2)}{x^2+2 q x+p^2}

Solution:

## Response

To determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{p+q}{p-q} \geq C\frac{2(x^2-2 q x+p^2)}{x^2+2 q x+p^2} 
\]

holds for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) where \( p > q > 0 \), we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Rearranging the Inequality

Start by rearranging the inequality:

\[
C \leq \frac{(p+q)(x^2+2qx+p^2)}{(p-q)2(x^2-2qx+p^2)} 
\]

### Step 2: Setting Up the Function 

Define the function:

\[
f(x) = \frac{(p+q)(x^2 + 2qx + p^2)}{(p-q)2(x^2 - 2qx + p^2)}
\]

### Step 3: Analyzing the Function 

To find the largest constant \( C \), we need to analyze the function \( f(x) \) to find its minimum across \( x \in \mathbb{R} \). 

### Step 4: Critical Points and Limits

1. **Find critical points:** Differentiate \( f(x) \) with respect to \( x \) and set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points. 
2. **Evaluate limits:** Examine the limits of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to \infty \) and \( x \to -\infty \) to ensure no larger constants could work.

### Step 5: Finding the Minimum Value

#### Case 1: As \( x \to \infty \)

\[
f(x) \to \frac{(p+q)}{(p-q)2} \quad \text{(dominated by \(x^2\) terms)}
\]

#### Case 2: As \( x \to -\infty \)

\[
f(x) \to \frac{(p+q)}{(p-q)2} \quad \text{(dominated by \(x^2\) terms)}
\]

#### Case 3: Evaluate \( f(x) \) at other key points, particularly around \( x = 0 \):

Calculate:

\[
f(0) = \frac{(p+q)p^2}{(p-q)2p^2} = \frac{(p+q)}{(p-q)2}
\]

### Step 6: Minimum Over the Domain

After evaluating these limits and \( f(0) \), find that:

\[
\min f(x) = f(0) = \frac{(p+q)}{(p-q)2}
\]

Thus, the largest \( C \) can be expressed as:

\[
C = \frac{(p+q)}{(p-q)2}
\]

### Final Answer

Recapping, we find that the maximum constant \( C \) such that the original inequality holds for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) is:

\[
\boxed{C = \frac{p+q}{(p-q)2}}
\]

Thus, the final statement requested:

```
'The answer is $C=\frac{p+q}{(p-q)2}$'
