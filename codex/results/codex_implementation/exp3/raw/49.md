Problem: Let $p > q > 0$. Determine the largest constants $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$:
$$
\frac{p+q}{p-q} \geq C\frac{2(x^2-2 q x+p^2)}{x^2+2 q x+p^2} 
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\frac{p+q}{p-q} \geq C\frac{2(x^2-2 q x+p^2)}{x^2+2 q x+p^2},
\]

we want to determine the largest constant \( C \) such that this holds for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Inequality 

We can rearrange the inequality:

\[
C \leq \frac{(p+q)(x^2 + 2qx + p^2)}{(p-q)(2(x^2 - 2qx + p^2))}.
\]

### Step 2: Simplify and Rearrange

Let's split the fraction:

\[
\frac{p+q}{p-q} \cdot \frac{x^2 + 2qx + p^2}{2(x^2 - 2qx + p^2)}.
\]

### Step 3: Find Critical Points 

To determine how \( C \) behaves, we need to analyze the critical points of the expression. We will evaluate at particular points, notably when \( x \) manages to approach critical functions such as behavior near limits or interesting values (0, \( p \), and \( q \)).

1. **At \( x = 0 \)**:

   \[
   \frac{(p+q)(0 + 0 + p^2)}{(p-q)(2(0 - 0 + p^2))} = \frac{(p+q)p^2}{(p-q)(2p^2)} = \frac{p+q}{2(p-q)}.
   \]

   Thus:

   \[
   C \leq \frac{p+q}{2(p-q)}.
   \]

2. **At \( x = p \)**:

   \[
   \frac{(p+q)(p^2 + 2qp + p^2)}{(p-q)(2(p^2 - 2qp + p^2))} = \frac{(p+q)(2p^2 + 2qp)}{(p-q)(2p^2 - 4qp)} = \frac{(p+q)(p+q)}{(p-q)(p-q)} = 1.
   \]

3. **At \( x = q \)** (where \( q < p \)):

   \[
   \frac{(p+q)(2q^2 + 2pq)}{(p-q)(2(q^2 - 2qp + p^2))}.
   \]

### Step 4: Assess Bounds

Through testing multiple values for \( x \), we can also assess that the expressions are increasing/decreasing throughout their respective ranges.

### Step 5: Determine Largest \( C \)

The value \( C \) will be maximized as we approach the transitions described. 

Given 

- At \( x=0 \): \( C \leq \frac{p+q}{2(p-q)} \).
- At other extreme values determined through testing yield similar expressions, and through evaluating the output we find the limiting behavior resolves towards approaching some maximum function bases.

From above, the constant \( C \) approaches its maximum determined as 

\[
C = \frac{p+q}{2(p-q)}.
\]

### Final Answer

Combining these derived values into the required form, we have:

``` 
The answer is $C=\frac{p+q}{2(p-q)}$. 
``` 
Thus, substituting the boundaries will yield us a concise representation of the bounds, displaying the maximal behavior given \( p, q > 0 \).

``` 
The answer is $C=1$.
