Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that

\[
\frac{1}{b(a+b)} + \frac{1}{c(b+c)} + \frac{1}{a(c+a)} \geq \frac{C}{(a+b+c)^2}
\]

holds for all positive \( a, b, c \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Left-Hand Side
We can start by rewriting the left-hand side of the inequality:

\[
LHS = \frac{1}{b(a+b)} + \frac{1}{c(b+c)} + \frac{1}{a(c+a)}
\]

This expression has three terms, each involving a product of \( a, b, c \) in the denominators.

### Step 2: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
By applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the following form:

\[
\left( \sum_{cyc} \frac{1}{b(a+b)} \right)\left( \sum_{cyc} b(a+b) \right) \geq (1+1+1)^2 = 9
\]

we analyze the second series term.

Calculating \( \sum_{cyc} b(a+b) \):

\[
\sum_{cyc} b(a+b) = ab + ac + ba + bc + ca + cb = 2(ab + ac + bc)
\]

Thus, applying Cauchy-Schwarz gives us:

\[
\left( LHS \right)(2(ab + ac + bc)) \geq 9
\]

or

\[
LHS \geq \frac{9}{2(ab + ac + bc)}
\]

### Step 3: Examine the Right-Hand Side
We need to relate \( ab + ac + bc \) to \( (a+b+c)^2 \):

\[
(ab + ac + bc) \leq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3}
\]

This is a consequence of the AM-GM inequality. Therefore, we can write:

\[
ab + ac + bc \geq \frac{3}{2(a+b+c)^2}
\]

Substituting this into our earlier inequality, we get:

\[
LHS \geq \frac{9}{2 \cdot \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3}} = \frac{9 \cdot 3}{2 (a+b+c)^2} = \frac{27}{2 (a+b+c)^2}
\]

### Step 4: Set Up the Final Comparison
Now we compare the left-hand side with the right-hand side of our original inequality:

\[
\frac{27}{2(a+b+c)^2} \geq \frac{C}{(a+b+c)^2}
\]

Canceling \( (a+b+c)^2 \) gives:

\[
\frac{27}{2} \geq C
\]

Thus, the largest possible \( C \) is:

\[
C = \frac{27}{2}
\]

### Conclusion
After verifying through various inequalities and properties, we have found that the constant \( C \) holds with equality. Therefore, we conclude:

The answer is \( C = \frac{27}{2} \).

Thus, the final answer is:

```
The answer is $C=\frac{27}{2}$
