Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start from the given condition:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]

This condition can be rewritten as:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 0
\]

By rearranging, we have:

\[
(a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2 = 0
\]

This implies that \(a = b = c\). Let's denote this common value by \(k\). Thus, we can substitute \(a = b = c = k\) into the inequality we want to analyze.

The inequality we need to prove becomes:

\[
3k \left( \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} \right) \geq C
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side yields:

\[
3k \cdot \frac{3}{k} = 9
\]

So we need to determine the largest constant \(C\) such that:

\[
9 \geq C
\]

Clearly, the largest constant \(C\) that satisfies this inequality is 9. 

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=9
\]
