## Response

To solve the inequality problem, we need to analyze the expression:

$$
\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}}
$$

and compare it with 

$$
2 \sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c}.
$$

### Step 1: Understanding the Cyclic Sum

The cyclic sum means we will evaluate the expression for all cyclic permutations of \(a, b, c\):

- The first term, \(\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}}\), can be rewritten as:
  
  \[
  \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} + \frac{c+a}{\sqrt{(b+c)(b+a)}} + \frac{a+b}{\sqrt{(c+a)(c+b)}}
  \]

### Step 2: Comparing the two expressions

To derive a useful comparison between the two expressions, we can explore their behavior under certain conditions:

1. Setting \(a = b = c\):
   - Both sides simplify and show equality.
   
2. Setting \(a \geq b = c\):
   - We need to evaluate if the left-hand side is greater than or equal to the right-hand side.
  
This method gives insights into how the terms behave under certain limits.

### Step 3: Applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[
\left( \sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{cyc} (b+c) \right) \left( \sum_{cyc} \frac{1}{(a+b)(a+c)} \right)
\]

This can lead to bounds over positive variables. 

### Step 4: Testing Cases

Testing edge cases provides guidance:

Setting \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) with specific relationships, such as:
- All equal
- Two equal, one distinct
- All distinct but in specific ratios

### Final Comparison

After analyzing the cyclic sums and their resulting values under the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, it can be conjectured that:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} \quad \geq \quad 2 \sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c}
\]

This leads to the conclusion that the correct comparison to fill in the blank in the inequality is:

**Answer:**
'"'"'The answer is (B) $\geq$'"'"'
