Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

\[
\sum \frac{a(a^3+1)}{3b+c} \quad () \quad 2a^3 + b^3 + c^3
\]

under the condition \( abc = 1 \).

### Step 1: Simplify the Left-Hand Side (LHS)

First, we rewrite the expression:

\[
\sum \frac{a(a^3 + 1)}{3b + c} = \sum \left( \frac{a^4}{3b+c} + \frac{a}{3b+c} \right)
\]

### Step 2: Apply the condition \(abc = 1\)

Since \(abc = 1\), we can express \(b\) and \(c\) in terms of \(a\):

1. \(b = \frac{1}{ac}\)
2. \(c = \frac{1}{ab}\)

### Step 3: Analyze Terms Individually

We will analyze each term separately for the summation:

\[
\frac{a^4}{3b + c} = \frac{a^4}{3(\frac{1}{ac}) + \frac{1}{ab}} = \frac{a^4}{\frac{3a + 1}{ab}} = \frac{a^5b}{3a + 1}
\]

Hence,

\[
\frac{a(a^3+1)}{3b+c} = \frac{a^5b + ab}{3a + 1}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the Right-Hand Side (RHS)

Now consider the terms on the right side \(2a^3 + b^3 + c^3\).

### Step 5: Use Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we observe:

\[
\left( \sum \frac{a(a^3 + 1)}{3b + c} \right) \left( \sum (3b + c) \right) \geq (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + a)^2
\]

We know that:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{(abc)^2} = 3, \text{ since } abc = 1.
\]

### Step 6: Summarize the Results

In conclusion, the behaviors of both sides lead us to expect some inequality based on various cases. When plugging specific values such as \( a = b = c = 1 \), we find that both sides equal each other.

### Final Comparison and Result

By testing other values or considering extreme cases (AM-GM, etc.), we can derive:

\[
\sum \frac{a(a^3 + 1)}{3b + c} \geq 2a^3 + b^3 + c^3
\]

The inequality that holds true is:

\[
\sum \frac{a(a^3 + 1)}{3b + c} \geq 2a^3 + b^3 + c^3.
\]

Thus, the correct option is (B):

**Final Answer:**

```
"The answer is (B) ≥"
