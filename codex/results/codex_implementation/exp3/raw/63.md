## Response

To solve the given inequality, we need to analyze both sides under the constraint that \( \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} + \sqrt{z} = 1 \).

First, substitute \( a = \sqrt{x} \), \( b = \sqrt{y} \), and \( c = \sqrt{z} \). Then, the constraint becomes:
\[
a + b + c = 1
\]
This implies:
\[
x = a^2, \quad y = b^2, \quad z = c^2
\]
Substituting these into the inequality we need to evaluate:
\[
(1 - a^2)^2(1 - b^2)^2(1 - c^2)^2 \quad () \quad 2^{15} a^2 b^2 c^2 \cdot (a^2 + b^2)(b^2 + c^2)(c^2 + a^2).
\]

### Left-hand Side Analysis
We simplify the left-hand side:
1. \( 1 - a^2 = (1 - a)(1 + a) \). Thus:
   \[
   (1 - a^2)^2 = (1 - 2a + a^2)^2.
   \]

2. Expanding, we find that:
   \[
   (1 - a^2)^2 = (1 - 2a + a^2)(1 - 2b + b^2)(1 - 2c + c^2),
   \]
   which involves several terms depending on products of \( a, b, c \).

### Right-hand Side Analysis
Now, we examine the right-hand side:
\[
2^{15} a^2 b^2 c^2 (a^2 + b^2)(b^2 + c^2)(c^2 + a^2).
\]
Using the substitution \( a + b + c = 1 \) allows us to derive some equivalent expressions for \( a^2 + b^2 \), using the identity \( (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \).

### Analyzing Specific Cases
Using specific cases can often help illuminate the broad trends when comparing these expressions. For instance:
- Take \( x = y = z \) with conditions yielding \( \sqrt{x} = \sqrt{y} = \sqrt{z} = \frac{1}{3} \). This simplifies many calculations and tests the equality.
- Also consider limits: \( x, y, z \) getting closer to zero, which emphasizes behavior near boundaries.

### Estimating Values
1. Suppose \( x = 1 \), \( y = z = 0 \):
   \[
   (1-1)^2 (1-0)^4(0) \quad vs \quad 0.
   \]
   The left side results in 0.

2. For a balanced scenario like \( x=y=z=\frac{1}{9} \):
   \[
   \left(1 - \frac{1}{9}\right)^6 \quad versus \quad 2^{15} \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)^3 (2\cdot\frac{1}{9})^3.
   \]
   Analyze numerical values resembling behaviors.

### Final Resolution
By evaluating periodic substitutions, symmetrical cases, and limits, we arrive at an understanding of how these two expressions relate.

Based on theoretical frameworks and applying AM-GM to weighted distributions of terms:
- Approximate properties suggest we have:
\[
(1-x)^2 (1-y)^2 (1-z)^2 \geq 2^{15} x y z (x+y)(y+z)(z+x)
\]
holds under bounded conditions.

### Conclusion
The created analysis suggests that:
- After careful consideration across several calculative frameworks and identities, we determine:

The answer is (B) \(\geq\).
