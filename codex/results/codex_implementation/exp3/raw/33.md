## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the inequality we want to validate under the condition \( abc = 1 \).

### Step 1: Rewrite the inequality

We need to determine the largest constant \( C \) such that:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq C
\]

### Step 2: Use the condition \( abc = 1 \)

From the condition \( abc = 1 \), we can express \( a, b, c \) in terms of \( x, y, z \) where \( a = \frac{x}{y}, b = \frac{y}{z}, c = \frac{z}{x} \). This maintains \( abc = 1\) as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{a} = \frac{y}{x}, \quad \frac{1}{b} = \frac{z}{y}, \quad \frac{1}{c} = \frac{x}{z}
\]

### Step 3: Apply AM-GM inequality 

By the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality (AM-GM), we have:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{abc}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{1}} = 1
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq 3
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion about \( C \)

This shows that \( C \) can be at most 3. Next, we need to check if \( C=3 \) is the sharp constant.

### Step 5: Case validation

Let's consider \( a = b = c \). If we set \( a = b = c = 1 \) (since \( abc = 1 \)), then:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} = 3
\]

Since we achieved equality here, this confirms that \( C = 3 \) holds.

### Step 6: Final statement

Since we cannot exceed the derived bound with other configurations of positive \( a, b, c \) while respecting \( abc = 1 \), we conclude:

\[
\text{The largest constant } C \text{ satisfying the inequality for all } a, b, c \text{ is } 3.
\]

Thus, we conclude the solution with the answer format specified:

```
The answer is $C=3$
