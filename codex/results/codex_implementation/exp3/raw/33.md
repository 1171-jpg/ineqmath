Solution:

## Response

To determine the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive reals \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( abc = 1 \), we can use the method of inequalities.

### Step 1: Rewrite the inequality 

Using the condition \( abc = 1 \), we can express \( a, b, c \) in terms of positive real variables. We can denote \( a = \frac{x}{y}, b = \frac{y}{z}, c = \frac{z}{x} \) for positive \( x, y, z \). 

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{a} = \frac{y}{x}, \quad \frac{1}{b} = \frac{z}{y}, \quad \frac{1}{c} = \frac{x}{z}.
\]

Substituting these into our inequality, we need to find constants such that:

\[
\frac{y}{x} + \frac{z}{y} + \frac{x}{z} \geq C.
\]

### Step 2: Apply AM-GM Inequality

By the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequalities (AM-GM), we know:

\[
\frac{y}{x} + \frac{z}{y} + \frac{x}{z} \geq 3\sqrt[3]{\frac{y}{x} \cdot \frac{z}{y} \cdot \frac{x}{z}} = 3,
\]

provided \( a, b, c \) are positive numbers such that \( abc = 1 \). 

### Step 3: Establishing the Bound

This suggests that our largest constant \( C \) is \( 3 \):

\[
C \leq 3.
\]

### Step 4: Show equality holds

To verify that \( 3 \) is indeed achievable, we can set \( a = b = c = 1 \). Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} = 3.
\]

### Conclusion

Since \( C = 3 \) holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) such that \( abc = 1 \), the largest constant is 

\[
\boxed{3}.
\]

Finally, in the required format, we state:

```
The answer is $C=3$.
