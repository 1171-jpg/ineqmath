## Response

To solve the inequality involving \( a, b, c > 0 \) where \( a + b + c = 1 \), we need to establish the relationship between \( 5(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \) and \( 6(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 1 \).

### Step 1: Analyze \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \)

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 \leq 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2).
\]
Thus,
\[
1^2 \leq 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \implies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 2: Consider the expression \( 5(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \)

From the relation established:
\[
5(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \geq 5 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \)

Using the Power Mean inequality or symmetry properties, we know:
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \leq \left(\frac{a + b + c}{3}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{27}.
\]
Thus,
\[
6(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) \leq 6 \cdot \frac{1}{27} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]

### Step 4: Combine the inequalities

Now, we need to evaluate:
\[
6(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 1 \leq \frac{2}{9} + 1 = \frac{2}{9} + \frac{9}{9} = \frac{11}{9}.
\]

### Step 5: Final inequality comparison

We need to compare:
1. From the analysis of \( 5(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \), we found it is \( \geq \frac{5}{3} \).
2. From the analysis of \( 6(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 1 \), we found it is \( \leq \frac{11}{9} \).

Since \( \frac{5}{3} = \frac{15}{9} \) and \( \frac{15}{9} > \frac{11}{9} \), we conclude:
\[
5(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) > 6(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 1.
\]

### Conclusion

The resulting inequality shows that:
\[
5(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \geq 6(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 1
\]
is not satisfied, leading us to fill in the blank with:

'"'"'The answer is (B) $\geq$'"'"'.
