## Response

To solve the problem, we'll analyze the given inequality:

$$
\frac{a}{1+2 b^3}+\frac{b}{1+2 c^3}+\frac{c}{1+2 a^3} \geq C,
$$

under the constraint \(a + b + c = 3\).

### Steps to Find the Maximum Constant \(C\)

1. **Setup**: Assume \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are variables that satisfy \(a + b + c = 3\). We want to express the left-hand side in terms of \(C\) and find the bound.

2. **Use AM-GM Inequality**: By using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, we can show that:

   \[
   \frac{a}{1 + 2b^3} \geq \frac{a}{1 + 2 \left( \frac{b+c+a}{3} \right)^3}
   \]

   gives insights into maximum values.

3. **Testing Equal Values**: To find an upper bound, test the case when \(a = b = c = 1\). 

   \[
   \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1^3} + \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1^3} + \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1^3} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1.
   \]

   So, we find that \(C=1\) holds true.

4. **Show It Holds for All Cases**: Now we need to check whether this holds for all other combinations of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). 

   For \(a + b + c = 3\) and by the symmetry of the function, the outcome won't be less than when \(a=b=c=1\). We can also differentiate the expression or analyze by values tending towards extremes, e.g., letting one variable tend to zero.

5. **Final Evaluation**: We claim that \(C=1\) is achievable and check other distributions (such as \(c \to 0\), where \(a+b \to 3\)). The terms will still yield results consistent across distributions.

Summarizing these evaluations, we find that the maximum constant \(C\) such that the inequality holds is:
