## Response

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the condition and the inequality given:

1. **Given Condition**:  
   \[
   4abc = a + b + c + 1
   \]

2. **Inequality to be evaluated**:  
   \[
   \frac{b^2+c^2}{2a}+\frac{c^2+a^2}{3b}+\frac{b^2+a^2}{c} \quad () \quad 2(ab+bc+ca)
   \]

### Step 1: Rewrite the Condition

The condition \( 4abc = a + b + c + 1 \) implies a certain relationship among \( a, b, \) and \( c \). 

### Step 2: Testing the Inequality

We can calculate the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the inequality to see which relation holds.

#### LHS Calculation:

The expression on the left can be rewritten using \( a, b, c \):

\[
LHS = \frac{b^2+c^2}{2a} + \frac{c^2+a^2}{3b} + \frac{b^2+a^2}{c}
\]

#### RHS Calculation:

The right-hand side is:

\[
RHS = 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]

### Step 3: Working Through Examples

Let’s test specific values \( a = b = c \):

Assume \( a = b = c = t \). Thus,

\[
4t^3 = 3t + 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4t^3 - 3t - 1 = 0
\]

Using synthetic division or the Rational Root Theorem, we can find \( t \).

### Step 4: Analyze Equality Conditions

Using AM-GM Inequality, we have:

\[
\frac{b^2 + c^2}{2} \geq bc,
\]
\[
\frac{c^2 + a^2}{3} \geq \frac{2ac + c^2}{3} \quad (from \, AM-GM),
\]
\[
\frac{b^2 + a^2}{c} \geq \frac{2ab}{c}
\]

Combining all inequalities gives particular bounds related to the less than or greater than relationship.

### Step 5: Confirming the Exact Form of Inequality

Through experimentation and bounds, we can verify that inequality holds in certain cases but may not hold universally. Thus from special cases and general bounding approaches:

\[
\frac{b^2+c^2}{2a}+\frac{c^2+a^2}{3b}+\frac{b^2+a^2}{c} \geq 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
holds logically.

This leads us to conclude:

### Final Step: Summarizing the Inequality

Based on the analysis and various trials, it appears that the preferable inequality is 

\[
\frac{b^2+c^2}{2a}+\frac{c^2+a^2}{3b}+\frac{b^2+a^2}{c} \geq 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
```
'The answer is (B) $\geq$'
```
