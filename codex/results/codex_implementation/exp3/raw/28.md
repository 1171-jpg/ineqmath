Problem: Let $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4$. Find the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$ satisfying the given constraint:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the minimal constant \( C \) such that:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq C
\]

for all \( a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R} \) with the constraint:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4.
\]

### Step 1: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) \geq (a + b + c + d)^2.
\]

Substituting the constraint \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \):

\[
(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3)(4) \geq (a + b + c + d)^2.
\]

Thus, we can rearrange this to find:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \geq \frac{(a + b + c + d)^2}{4}.
\]

### Step 2: Find Maximum Values of \( a + b + c + d \)

To maximize \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \), we should maximize \( a + b + c + d \) under the constraint \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \). The maximum occurs when \( a, b, c, d \) take the same value due to symmetry.

Let \( a = b = c = d = x \). Then we have:

\[
4x^2 = 4 \implies x^2 = 1 \implies x = 1 \text{ or } x = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( a+b+c+d \)

Using \( a = b = c = d = 1 \):

\[
a + b + c + d = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.
\]

Now substituting back to find \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \):

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 = 1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3 = 4.
\]

### Step 4: Find Constant \( C \)

Thus, we have established:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq 4.
\]

This gives us the upper bound that we were looking for. Therefore, the minimal constant \( C \) that satisfies the original inequality for all \( a, b, c, d \) with the given constraint is:

\[
C = 4.
\]

### Conclusion

Therefore, the final answer is:

```
The answer is $C=4$
```
