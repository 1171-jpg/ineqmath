Problem: Let $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4$. Find the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To find the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq C
\]

holds true under the constraint 

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4, 
\]

we can make use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 

### Step 1: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

According to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[
(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)(a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4) \geq (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3)^2.
\]

### Step 2: Substitute the Constraint

Given \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \), we can substitute into our inequality:

\[
4(a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4) \geq (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3)^2.
\]

### Step 3: Introduce a New Variable

Let \( S = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \). Rearranging gives us:

\[
S^2 \leq 4(a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4).
\]

### Step 4: Find \( a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 \)

To find an upper bound for \( a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 \), we will use the Power Mean inequality:

\[
\left( \frac{a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4}{4} \right)^{1/4} \leq \left( \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2}{4} \right)^{1/2}.
\]

This leads to:

\[
\frac{a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4}{4} \leq \left( \frac{4}{4} \right)^2 = 1 \implies a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 \leq 4.
\]

### Step 5: Returning to the Inequality

Now substituting this back into our rearranged inequality:

\[
S^2 \leq 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \implies S \leq \sqrt{16} = 4.
\]

### Step 6: Find the Minimum Value of \( C \)

Since we have \( S = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq 4 \), we can conclude that the minimal constant \( C \) for which the inequality holds is:

\[
C = 4.
\]

### Final Conclusion

Thus, the answer is 

```plaintext
'The answer is $C=4$'
