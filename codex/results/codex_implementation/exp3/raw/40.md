## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

\[
\frac{a+1}{a+b+1} + \frac{b+1}{b+c+1} + \frac{c+1}{c+a+1} \geq C
\]

given the constraint \( a + b + c = 3 \) where \( a, b, c \geq 0 \). Our goal is to determine the largest constant \( C \) for which this inequality holds true for all non-negative \( a, b, \) and \( c \).

### Step 1: Analyze individual fractions

Each term of the left-hand side can be expressed separately:

- Let's denote 
  \[
  S = \frac{a+1}{a+b+1} + \frac{b+1}{b+c+1} + \frac{c+1}{c+a+1}
  \]
  
By substituting \( a+b+c = 3 \) intoeach term, we explore specific cases.

### Step 2: Test special cases

**Case 1:** Let \( a = 3 \) and \( b = c = 0 \):
\[
S = \frac{3+1}{3+0+1} + \frac{0+1}{0+0+1} + \frac{0+1}{0+3+1} = \frac{4}{4} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{4} = 1 + 1 + 0.25 = 2.25
\]

**Case 2:** Let \( a = b = c = 1 \):
\[
S = \frac{1+1}{1+1+1} + \frac{1+1}{1+1+1} + \frac{1+1}{1+1+1} = 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2
\]

**Case 3:** Let \( a = 2, b = 1, c = 0 \):
\[
S = \frac{2+1}{2+1+1} + \frac{1+1}{1+0+1} + \frac{0+1}{0+2+1} = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{4} + 1 + \frac{1}{3}
\]

Calculating \(\frac{3}{4} + 1 + \frac{1}{3}\):
\[
= \frac{3}{4} + \frac{4}{4} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{4} + \frac{1}{3}
\]

Finding a common denominator:
The LCM of 4 and 3 is 12:
\[
= \frac{21}{12} + \frac{4}{12} = \frac{25}{12} \approx 2.0833
\]

### Step 3: Finding the minimum value of \( S \)

From our test cases, we observe:
- From \(a = 3, b = 0, c = 0\): \(S = 2.25\)
- From \(a = b = c = 1\): \(S = 2\)
- From \(a = 2, b = 1, c = 0\): \(S \approx 2.0833\)

The minimum observed value is 2 from the case of \(a = b = c = 1\).

### Step 4: Conclude with the largest constant \( C \)

Since we ensured all cases maintain values of \(S \geq 2\), we can conclude:
\[
C = 2
\]

Thus, the final answer is 

**The answer is \(C=2\)**.
