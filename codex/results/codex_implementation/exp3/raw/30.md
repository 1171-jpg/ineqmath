## Response

To determine the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\left(a+\frac{1}{a}\right)^2+\left(b+\frac{1}{b}\right)^2 \geq C
\]

holds for all \( a, b > 0 \) where \( a + b = 1 \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( b \) in terms of \( a \)**:
   Given \( a + b = 1 \), we have \( b = 1 - a \).

2. **Rewrite the inequality**:
   Substitute \( b \) into the inequality:
   \[
   \left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2 + \left(1 - a + \frac{1}{1-a}\right)^2 \geq C
   \]

3. **Define function**:
   Let us define \( f(a) = \left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2 + \left(1-a + \frac{1}{1-a}\right)^2 \).

4. **Find the derivative**:
   To find the minimum value of \( f(a) \) over the interval \( (0, 1) \), we can take the derivative \( f'(a) \) and find critical points.

5. **Setting up the function**:
   Calculate and simplify \( f(a) \):
   \[
   = \left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1-a}{1-a} + \frac{1}{1-a}\right)^2
   \]
   \[
   = \left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2 + \left(1-a + \frac{1}{1-a}\right)^2
   \]

6. **Evaluating the extreme points**:
   We can evaluate \( f(a) \) at \( a = \frac{1}{2} \):
   \[
   f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2} + 2\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2} + 2\right)^2 = 2 \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{25}{4} = \frac{50}{4} = 12.5
   \]

7. **Find limits**:
   Check the behavior of \( f(a) \) as \( a \to 0 \) and \( a \to 1 \):
   - As \( a \to 0^+ \):
     \[
     f(a) \to \infty
     \]
   - As \( a \to 1^- \):
     \[
     f(a) \to \infty
     \]

8. **Conclusion**:
   The minimum occurs at \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) yielding \( f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 12.5 \).

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) for the inequality to hold for all \( a, b > 0 \) such that \( a + b = 1 \) is 

\[
C = 12.5.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

```
The answer is $C=12.5$
