## Response

To solve the problem, we will derive an inequality for the sum of squares of the numbers given the constraints.

### Step 1: Analyze the Given Conditions

We know that:
1. \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = 0 \)
2. \( \max \{|a_i - a_j| \mid 1 \leq i, j \leq n\} \leq 1 \)

The second condition means that the values \( a_i \) are all constrained within an interval of length 1. Thus, if we say \( a_i \) is within the interval \([x, x+1]\), the deviation between any two values \( a_i \) and \( a_j \) must be no greater than 1.

### Step 2: Establish Bounds

Let’s denote the minimum and maximum of the \( a_i \) values:
- \( m = \min(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) \)
- \( M = \max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) \)

From the constraints, we deduce:
- \( M - m \leq 1 \), or \( M \leq m + 1 \).

### Step 3: Using the Sum of Squares Formula

We are tasked with analyzing \( a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 \).

Using the identity:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_i - \bar{a})^2 + n \bar{a}^2
\]
where \( \bar{a} = \frac{1}{n}(a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n) = 0 \).

Thus, we have:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_i - 0)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2
\]

### Step 4: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
\[
(n)(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2) \geq (a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n)^2
\]
Since \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = 0 \), we have:
\[
n \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 \geq 0 \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 \geq 0
\]

### Step 5: Establish a Bound

Given \( |a_i| \leq m + 1 \) and \( a_i + a_j = 0 \) for the choices of \( a_i, a_j \) that equal 0, we can assess:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (a^2_i) \quad \text{is minimal when centered around 0.}
\]
Because the maximum deviation is 1, we find the upper bound for \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 \).

### Step 6: Compare to the Given Expression

The given expression \( \frac{1}{n}\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right] \) when analyzed shows that it creates matching terms with selections \( n \) at intervals deriving from symmetric selections about zero.

Thus, we can analyze:
1. If \( n = 2 \): The maximum of squared sums effectively provides equality.
2. If instead \( n \) provides bounds through iterative selections tending to zero.

From the obtained structure, we obtain that \( a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 \) will always be greater than \( \frac{1}{n}\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right] \).

### Conclusion

Based on these analyses, it's clear that:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 \geq \frac{1}{n}\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right]
\]

'The answer is (B) ≥'
