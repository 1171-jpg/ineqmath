Problem: Let $x > 4$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x$:

$$
\frac{x^3}{x-4} \geq C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

$$
\frac{x^3}{x-4} \geq C.
$$

for \( x > 4 \). The goal is to find the largest constant \( C \) such that this inequality holds for all \( x > 4 \).

### Steps to Solve

1. **Rearranging the Inequality**:
   Rearranging gives us:
   $$
   \frac{x^3}{x-4} - C \geq 0.
   $$
   We can rewrite this as:
   $$
   \frac{x^3 - C(x - 4)}{x - 4} \geq 0.
   $$
   This simplifies to:
   $$
   x^3 - Cx + 4C \geq 0.
   $$

2. **Setting the Polynomial**:
   Let:
   $$
   f(x) = x^3 - Cx + 4C.
   $$
   We need \( f(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x > 4 \).

3. **Finding Critical Points**:
   To find critical points, we take the derivative:
   $$
   f'(x) = 3x^2 - C.
   $$
   Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:
   $$
   3x^2 - C = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{C}{3} \implies x = \sqrt{\frac{C}{3}}.
   $$

4. **Analyzing the Critical Point**:
   We need \( x > 4 \), so we require:
   $$
   \sqrt{\frac{C}{3}} > 4 \implies C > 48.
   $$

5. **Evaluating the Function at \( x = 4 \)**:
   Next, evaluate the function at \( x = 4 \):
   $$
   f(4) = 4^3 - C \cdot 4 + 4C = 64 - 4C + 4C = 64.
   $$
   \( f(4) = 64 \), which is positive.

6. **Behavior as \( x \to \infty \)**:
   As \( x \to \infty \):
   $$
   f(x) \to \infty,
   $$
   since the leading term \( x^3 \) dominates the expression.

7. **Finding the Maximum \( C \)**:
   To ensure \( f(x) \) maintains non-negativity for all \( x > 4 \), we want the condition \( C = 48 \), as it is the boundary we calculated where the polynomial is still non-negative.

### Conclusion

By analyzing the conditions required for \( f(x) \) to be non-negative for all \( x > 4 \), we conclude that the largest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality is:

\[
C = 48.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

```plaintext
'The answer is $C=48$'
