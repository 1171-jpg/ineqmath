Problem: Let $x > 4$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x$:

$$
\frac{x^3}{x-4} \geq C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem and determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{x^3}{x - 4} \geq C
\]

holds for all \( x > 4 \), we will analyze the function 

\[
f(x) = \frac{x^3}{x - 4}.
\]

### Step 1: Find the Minimum Value of \( f(x) \)

To find the largest possible \( C \), we need to find the minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x > 4 \).

### Step 2: Differentiate \( f(x) \)

Using the quotient rule for differentiation, we find \( f'(x) \):

\[
f'(x) = \frac{(x - 4)(3x^2) - (x^3)(1)}{(x - 4)^2}.
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{3x^2(x - 4) - x^3}{(x - 4)^2} = \frac{3x^3 - 12x^2 - x^3}{(x - 4)^2} = \frac{2x^3 - 12x^2}{(x - 4)^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Set \( f'(x) \) to Zero

To find critical points, we set the numerator equal to zero:

\[
2x^3 - 12x^2 = 0.
\]

Factoring out \( 2x^2 \):

\[
2x^2(x - 6) = 0.
\]

Thus, we have two solutions: \( x = 0 \) (not valid since \( x > 4 \)) and \( x = 6 \).

### Step 4: Evaluate \( f(x) \) at Critical Points

Next, we evaluate \( f(6) \):

\[
f(6) = \frac{6^3}{6 - 4} = \frac{216}{2} = 108.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the Behavior as \( x \to 4^+ \) and as \( x \to \infty \)

- As \( x \to 4^+ \):
  \[
  f(x) \to \infty \quad \text{(since the denominator approaches 0 from the positive side)}.
  \]

- As \( x \to \infty \):
  \[
  f(x) \to \infty \quad \text{(since the degree of the numerator is higher than the denominator)}.
  \]

### Step 6: Determine Minimum on \( (4, \infty) \)

The minimum value observed occurs at the critical point \( x = 6 \), which yields \( f(6) = 108 \). Since \( f(x) \) tends to infinity as \( x \) approaches both 4 and infinity, \( C \) can be set to this minimum.

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( x > 4 \) is:

\[
C = 108.
\]

### Conclusion

Hence, the answer is 

```
The answer is $C=108$
