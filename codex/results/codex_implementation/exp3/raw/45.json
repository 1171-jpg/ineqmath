    "response": "To solve the problem and determine the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality \n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^3}{x - 4} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all \\( x > 4 \\), we will analyze the function \n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{x^3}{x - 4}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Find the Minimum Value of \\( f(x) \\)\n\nTo find the largest possible \\( C \\), we need to find the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) for \\( x > 4 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Differentiate \\( f(x) \\)\n\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, we find \\( f'(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{(x - 4)(3x^2) - (x^3)(1)}{(x - 4)^2}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{3x^2(x - 4) - x^3}{(x - 4)^2} = \\frac{3x^3 - 12x^2 - x^3}{(x - 4)^2} = \\frac{2x^3 - 12x^2}{(x - 4)^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Set \\( f'(x) \\) to Zero\n\nTo find critical points, we set the numerator equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n2x^3 - 12x^2 = 0.\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\( 2x^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n2x^2(x - 6) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThus, we have two solutions: \\( x = 0 \\) (not valid since \\( x > 4 \\)) and \\( x = 6 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate \\( f(x) \\) at Critical Points\n\nNext, we evaluate \\( f(6) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(6) = \\frac{6^3}{6 - 4} = \\frac{216}{2} = 108.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Behavior as \\( x \\to 4^+ \\) and as \\( x \\to \\infty \\)\n\n- As \\( x \\to 4^+ \\):\n  \\[\n  f(x) \\to \\infty \\quad \\text{(since the denominator approaches 0 from the positive side)}.\n  \\]\n\n- As \\( x \\to \\infty \\):\n  \\[\n  f(x) \\to \\infty \\quad \\text{(since the degree of the numerator is higher than the denominator)}.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 6: Determine Minimum on \\( (4, \\infty) \\)\n\nThe minimum value observed occurs at the critical point \\( x = 6 \\), which yields \\( f(6) = 108 \\). Since \\( f(x) \\) tends to infinity as \\( x \\) approaches both 4 and infinity, \\( C \\) can be set to this minimum.\n\nThus, the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all \\( x > 4 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nC = 108.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHence, the answer is \n\n```\nThe answer is $C=108$\n```\n",
