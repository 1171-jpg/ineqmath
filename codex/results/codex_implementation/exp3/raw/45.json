    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality \n\n$$\n\\frac{x^3}{x-4} \\geq C.\n$$\n\nfor \\( x > 4 \\). The goal is to find the largest constant \\( C \\) such that this inequality holds for all \\( x > 4 \\).\n\n### Steps to Solve\n\n1. **Rearranging the Inequality**:\n   Rearranging gives us:\n   $$\n   \\frac{x^3}{x-4} - C \\geq 0.\n   $$\n   We can rewrite this as:\n   $$\n   \\frac{x^3 - C(x - 4)}{x - 4} \\geq 0.\n   $$\n   This simplifies to:\n   $$\n   x^3 - Cx + 4C \\geq 0.\n   $$\n\n2. **Setting the Polynomial**:\n   Let:\n   $$\n   f(x) = x^3 - Cx + 4C.\n   $$\n   We need \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x > 4 \\).\n\n3. **Finding Critical Points**:\n   To find critical points, we take the derivative:\n   $$\n   f'(x) = 3x^2 - C.\n   $$\n   Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n   $$\n   3x^2 - C = 0 \\implies x^2 = \\frac{C}{3} \\implies x = \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{3}}.\n   $$\n\n4. **Analyzing the Critical Point**:\n   We need \\( x > 4 \\), so we require:\n   $$\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{3}} > 4 \\implies C > 48.\n   $$\n\n5. **Evaluating the Function at \\( x = 4 \\)**:\n   Next, evaluate the function at \\( x = 4 \\):\n   $$\n   f(4) = 4^3 - C \\cdot 4 + 4C = 64 - 4C + 4C = 64.\n   $$\n   \\( f(4) = 64 \\), which is positive.\n\n6. **Behavior as \\( x \\to \\infty \\)**:\n   As \\( x \\to \\infty \\):\n   $$\n   f(x) \\to \\infty,\n   $$\n   since the leading term \\( x^3 \\) dominates the expression.\n\n7. **Finding the Maximum \\( C \\)**:\n   To ensure \\( f(x) \\) maintains non-negativity for all \\( x > 4 \\), we want the condition \\( C = 48 \\), as it is the boundary we calculated where the polynomial is still non-negative.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the conditions required for \\( f(x) \\) to be non-negative for all \\( x > 4 \\), we conclude that the largest constant \\( C \\) that satisfies the inequality is:\n\n\\[\nC = 48.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```plaintext\n'The answer is $C=48$'\n```\n",
