## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given inequality:

\[
abc\left(a+\sqrt{a^2+1}\right)\left(b+\sqrt{b^2+1}\right)\left(c+\sqrt{c^2+1}\right) \quad () \quad 2
\]

given the condition \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).

### Step 1: Exploring the Terms

We can rewrite each term \(a + \sqrt{a^2 + 1}\):

\[
a + \sqrt{a^2+1} = a + \sqrt{a^2 + 1} = a + \sqrt{a^2(1 + \frac{1}{a^2})} = a + a\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{a^2}} = a(1 + \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{a^2}})
\]

This representation shows that each term grows at least linearly or more with respect to \(a\).

### Step 2: Evaluating the Product

Thus, we have:

\[
abc\left(a+\sqrt{a^2+1}\right)\left(b+\sqrt{b^2+1}\right)\left(c+\sqrt{c^2+1}\right) = abc \times a(1 + \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{a^2}}) \times b(1 + \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{b^2}}) \times c(1 + \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{c^2}})
\]

This product will be positive since \(a, b, c > 0\).

### Step 3: Analyzing Bounds

Let's evaluate the upper bound. It helps to examine special cases or use inequalities:

1. **Using AM-GM inequality on \(abc\)**:
   By AM-GM, we can say:
   \[
   a + b + c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{abc}
   \]
   Since \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we examine \(\sqrt[3]{abc}\) further. By applying AM-GM:
   \[
   ab + bc + ca \geq 3\sqrt[3]{(abc)^2}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   1 \geq 3\sqrt[3]{(abc)^2}
   \]
   leading to:
   \[
   abc \leq \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.192
   \]

2. **Geometric Considerations**:
   Let's focus on \( \left(a + \sqrt{a^2 + 1}\right) \):
   \[
   a+\sqrt{a^2+1} \geq \sqrt{2a^2 + 1} \geq \sqrt{2}
   \]
   for given positive \(a\).

### Step 4: Final Evaluation

Consequently, we can replace the original product with expressions that grow relatively larger:

1. Putting these bounds together, the entire left-hand product grows, but \(2\) is a strict constant where we surmise it doesn't exceed some upper bounds derived particularly through bounds of AM-GM:

\[
abc\left(a+\sqrt{a^2+1}\right)\left(b+\sqrt{b^2+1}\right)\left(c+\sqrt{c^2+1}\right) < 2
\]

Moreover, as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) shrink within the constraints of \(ab + ac + bc = 1\).

### Conclusion

Thus, with the reasoning above, we can assert the relation:

\[
abc\left(a+\sqrt{a^2+1}\right)\left(b+\sqrt{b^2+1}\right)\left(c+\sqrt{c^2+1}\right) < 2
\]

This leads us to conclude:

The answer is (A) $\leq$
