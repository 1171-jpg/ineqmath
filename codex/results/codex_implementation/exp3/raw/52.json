    "response": "To solve the problem involving the inequality \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a b c} + \\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \\quad () \\quad 1,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a, b, c \\in (0,1) \\), we will analyze two parts of the expression.\n\n### Steps of the Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Terms**:\n   - The term \\(\\sqrt{abc}\\) is the geometric mean of \\( a, b, c \\).\n   - The term \\(\\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)}\\) is the geometric mean of \\( (1-a), (1-b), (1-c) \\).\n\n2. **Applying AM-GM Inequality**:\n   - By the **Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM)** inequality, we know that for any non-negative numbers \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\):\n\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_n}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n}\n     \\]\n\n   - Applying this to \\( a, b, c \\),\n     \\[\n     \\frac{a + b + c}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{abc}.\n     \\]\n\n   - Similarly,\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(1-a) + (1-b) + (1-c)}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Boundaries**:\n   - Since \\( a, b, c \\) lie in \\( (0, 1) \\), both \\( \\sqrt{abc} \\) and \\(\\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)}\\) are at most 1 because \\( a, b, c < 1 \\).\n   - This implies that each geometric mean will contribute positively yet will be less than or equal to 1.\n\n4. **Testing the Sum**:\n   - The maximum possible value of \\( \\sqrt{abc} + \\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \\) occurs when both terms are at their individual maximums simultaneously.\n   - Since both terms can reach their peak values (1 when \\( a, b, c \\) are very close to 1, and 0 when \\( 1-a, 1-b, 1-c \\) are near zero), we can conclude that:\n\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{abc} + \\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} < 2.\n     \\]\n\n   - However, we need to check when this might approach or involve 1.\n\n5. **Evaluating Specific Cases**:\n   - Let\u2019s consider \\( a = b = c = 0.5 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{0.5 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot 0.5} + \\sqrt{(1-0.5)(1-0.5)(1-0.5)} = \\sqrt{0.125} + \\sqrt{0.125} = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{0.125} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.707 < 1.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final Evaluation**:\n   - The inequality must hold true for the cases in which both \\(\\sqrt{abc}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)}\\) cannot individually reach one without exceeding it, leading us to conclude that it indeed holds less than 1 under the provided constraints.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, we conclude that the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{abc} + \\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is \n\n'\"'The answer is (A) $\\leq$'\"'\n",
