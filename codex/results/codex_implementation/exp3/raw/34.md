Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \):

\[
\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{c}+\frac{c}{a} \geq \frac{C \sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}{\sqrt[3]{abc}}
\]

### Step 1: Understand the components

1. **Left-hand side**: This is the sum of the fractions, which has known properties.
2. **Right-hand side**: It involves the geometric mean \( \sqrt[3]{abc} \) and the quadratic mean \( \sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2} \).

### Step 2: Apply known inequalities

Using the **AM-GM inequality**:

\[
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a} \geq 3\sqrt[3]{\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{c} \cdot \frac{c}{a}} = 3
\]

This suggests that \( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a} \) is bounded from below by \( 3 \).

### Step 3: Analyze the inequality

To satisfy the inequality as \( a, b, c \) vary, we explore when the left-hand side is maximized:
- This might happen when \( a = b = c \). We can set \( a = b = c = 1 \) to find a simple bound.

### Step 4: Calculate the inequality under symmetry

Substituting \( a = b = c = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} = 3
\]

The right-hand side becomes:

\[
\frac{C \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}}{\sqrt[3]{1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}} = C \sqrt{3}
\]

So we need:

\[
3 \geq C \sqrt{3}
\]

Dividing both sides by \( \sqrt{3} \):

\[
C \leq \frac{3}{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{3}
\]

### Step 5: Validating the bound

We need to check if \( C = \sqrt{3} \) works for all positive \( a, b, c \). 
Using the **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality**:

\[
(a^2+b^2+c^2)\left(\frac{1}{b^2}+\frac{1}{c^2}+\frac{1}{a^2}\right) \geq (1+1+1)^2 = 9
\]

Hence, 

\[
\frac{a}{b}+\frac{b}{c}+\frac{c}{a} \geq 3 \quad \text{implies} \quad C = \sqrt{3} \text{ fits the requirement.}
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=\sqrt{3}.
