Problem: Find the smallest constant $C$ such that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, the following inequality holds:
$$
x^2 + x + y^2 + y + C \geq x y
$$

Solution:

## Response

To find the smallest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
x^2 + x + y^2 + y + C \geq x y
\]

holds for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we can rearrange the inequality as follows:

\[
x^2 - xy + y^2 + x + y + C \geq 0.
\]

Next, we focus on the quadratic form in \( x \) and find conditions under which it remains non-negative.

### Step 1: Identify the quadratic form

The expression can be viewed as a quadratic in \( x \):

\[
f(x) = x^2 - xy + (y^2 + y + C).
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the discriminant

For \( f(x) \) to be non-negative for all \( x \), the discriminant of the quadratic must be less than or equal to zero:

\[
D = b^2 - 4ac = (-y)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (y^2 + y + C).
\]

Calculating this,

\[
D = y^2 - 4(y^2 + y + C) = y^2 - 4y^2 - 4y - 4C = -3y^2 - 4y - 4C.
\]

### Step 3: Set discriminant less than or equal to zero

We require:

\[
-3y^2 - 4y - 4C \leq 0.
\]

This is a quadratic in \( y \). For this to hold for all \( y \), the discriminant of this quadratic must also be non-positive:

### Step 4: Discriminant of \(-3y^2 - 4y - 4C\)

The discriminant \( D' \) is given by:

\[
D' = (-4)^2 - 4(-3)(-4C) = 16 - 48C \leq 0.
\]

### Step 5: Solve the inequality for \( C \)

Solving \( 16 - 48C \leq 0 \):

\[
16 \leq 48C \implies C \geq \frac{16}{48} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) for which the inequality holds for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) is 

\[
C = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

So, the final answer is:

```
'The answer is $C=\frac{1}{3}$'
```
