Problem: Find the smallest constant $C$ such that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, the following inequality holds:
$$
x^2 + x + y^2 + y + C \geq x y
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
x^2 + x + y^2 + y + C \geq xy
\]

we can rearrange it as follows:

\[
x^2 - xy + y^2 + x + y + C \geq 0
\]

This is a quadratic inequality in terms of \(x\):

\[
x^2 - (y - 1)x + (y^2 + y + C) \geq 0
\]

For this quadratic in \(x\) to be non-negative for all values of \(x\), its discriminant should be less than or equal to zero:

\[
D = (y - 1)^2 - 4(y^2 + y + C) \leq 0
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
D = (y - 1)^2 - 4(y^2 + y + C) 
\]
\[
= y^2 - 2y + 1 - 4y^2 - 4y - 4C
\]
\[
= -3y^2 - 6y + 1 - 4C
\]

We require:

\[
-3y^2 - 6y + 1 - 4C \leq 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation in terms of \(y\). The discriminant of this quadratic must also be less than or equal to zero for the inequality to hold for all \(y\):

\[
D_y = (-6)^2 - 4(-3)(1 - 4C) \leq 0
\]
\[
= 36 + 12(1 - 4C) \leq 0
\]
\[
= 36 + 12 - 48C \leq 0
\]
\[
= 48 - 48C \leq 0
\]
\[
C \geq 1
\]

Thus, the smallest constant \(C\) such that the original inequality holds for all \(x\) and \(y\) is 

\[
C = 1
\]

Therefore, we have:

```
The answer is $C=1$
```
