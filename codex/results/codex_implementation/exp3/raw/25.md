Problem: Let $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$:

$$
\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{4}{c}+\frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c+d}

Solution:

## Response

To find the largest constant \( C \) such that the following inequality holds for all \( a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}^{+} \):

\[
\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{4}{c}+\frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c+d}
\]

we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers \( x_i \) and \( y_i \):

\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i^2}{y_i} \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \right) \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right)^2
\]

### Step 1: Applying Cauchy-Schwarz

Let’s set:
- \( x_1 = 1, y_1 = a \)
- \( x_2 = 1, y_2 = b \)
- \( x_3 = 2, y_3 = c \) (since \( \frac{4}{c} = \frac{2^2}{c} \))
- \( x_4 = 4, y_4 = d \) (since \( \frac{16}{d} = \frac{4^2}{d} \))

Using Cauchy-Schwarz gives us:

\[
\left( \frac{1^2}{a} + \frac{1^2}{b} + \frac{2^2}{c} + \frac{4^2}{d} \right) \bigg( a + b + c + d \bigg) \geq \left( 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 \right)^2
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8^2 = 64
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the inequality as:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \right) (a + b + c + d) \geq 64
\]

### Step 2: Rearranging and Isolating \( C \)

Rearranging gives us:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{64}{a + b + c + d}
\]

This tells us that \( C \) must be at most 64. 

### Step 3: Testing for Equality

To confirm if \( C = 64 \) is the maximum value, we can consider the case where \( a, b, c, d \) are all equal:

Let \( a = b = c = d = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{4}{1} + \frac{16}{1} = 1 + 1 + 4 + 16 = 22
\]

And 

\[
C = \frac{64}{1 + 1 + 1 + 1} = 16
\]

This shows the equality holds.

### Conclusion

The largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c, d \) is 

\[
\boxed{64}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

```
The answer is $C=64$
