## Response

To solve the problem, we are tasked with demonstrating the relationship between two expressions given that \( a, b, c > 0 \) and \( a b c = 1 \). 

We need to evaluate the inequality:

\[
\frac{a^{10}}{b+c}+\frac{b^{10}}{c+a}+\frac{c^{10}}{a+b} \quad () \quad \frac{a^7}{b^7+c^7}+\frac{b^7}{c^7+a^7}+\frac{c^7}{a^7+b^7}.
\]

### Step 1: Analyzing both sides using AM-GM Inequality

Using the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality, we can analyze the terms in both sums.

For the first sum, we note:

\[
b + c \geq 2\sqrt{bc}, \quad \text{thus} \quad \frac{a^{10}}{b + c} \leq \frac{a^{10}}{2 \sqrt{bc}}.
\]

Similarly for \( b \) and \( c \), we have:

\[
\frac{b^{10}}{c + a} \leq \frac{b^{10}}{2 \sqrt{ca}}, \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{c^{10}}{a + b} \leq \frac{c^{10}}{2 \sqrt{ab}}.
\]

Thus, collating these inequalities:

\[
\frac{a^{10}}{b+c} + \frac{b^{10}}{c+a} + \frac{c^{10}}{a+b} \leq \frac{a^{10}}{2 \sqrt{bc}} + \frac{b^{10}}{2 \sqrt{ca}} + \frac{c^{10}}{2 \sqrt{ab}}.
\]

### Step 2: Applying the conditions of \( abc = 1 \)

From the condition \( abc = 1 \), we express each variable in terms of the others, for example, \( a = \frac{1}{bc} \), thus replacing the variables leads to:

To simplify:

1. From the first sum, we see that \( a^{10}, b^{10}, c^{10} \) would dominate their respective denominators as they grow larger due to higher powers.
2. In comparison, the second sum:

Using AM-GM again, consider:

\[
b^7 + c^7 \geq 2\sqrt{b^7c^7} = 2bc^{7/2},
\]

then we see:

\[
\frac{a^7}{b^7 + c^7} \leq \frac{a^7}{2bc^{7/2}}.
\]

Using the same logic, we can state that:

\[
\frac{a^7}{b^7 + c^7} + \frac{b^7}{c^7 + a^7} + \frac{c^7}{a^7 + b^7} \leq \text{(similar bound)}.
\]

### Step 3: Relating both sums

Comparing the bounds from both expressions under our equality:

From the equality case of AM-GM, equality occurs when all variables are equal, therefore the relationship becomes:

\[
\frac{a^{10}}{b+c} + \frac{b^{10}}{c+a} + \frac{c^{10}}{a+b} \quad > \quad \frac{a^7}{b^7+c^7} + \frac{b^7}{c^7+a^7} + \frac{c^7}{a^7+b^7},
\]

for \( a, b, c > 0 \).

### Final Conclusion

Thus the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

```
'The answer is (A) $\leq$'
```
