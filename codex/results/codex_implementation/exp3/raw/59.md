## Response

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the expression \( |x - y + z| \) subject to the constraint \( x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = \frac{2}{5} a^2 \).

### Step 1: Understanding the Constraint

The constraint can be interpreted as describing an ellipsoid centered at the origin. The coefficients of \(x^2\), \(y^2\), and \(z^2\) indicate the axis scaling in each direction:

\[
\frac{x^2}{\frac{2}{5}a^2} + \frac{y^2}{\frac{1}{5}a^2} + \frac{z^2}{\frac{2}{5}a^2} = 1
\]

This means that the maximum distances along the \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) axes are determined by the lengths of the semi-axes of the ellipsoid.

### Step 2: Applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

To find \( |x - y + z| \), we can employ the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the following way:

\[
(x - y + z)^2 \leq (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)(x^2 + z^2 + y^2)
\]

This gives us:

\[
(x - y + z)^2 \leq 3(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
\]

Using our constraint, we can rewrite \(x^2, y^2, z^2\) as follows:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = \frac{2}{5} a^2
\]

### Step 3: Bounding \( |x - y + z| \)

From the above inequalities, we get:

\[
(x - y + z)^2 \leq 3\left(\frac{2}{5} a^2\right) = \frac{6}{5} a^2
\]

Taking the square root gives us:

\[
|x - y + z| \leq \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} a
\]

### Step 4: Evaluation

Now we need to evaluate the relationship between \( |x - y + z| \) and \( a \). Given:

\[
|x - y + z| \leq \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} a
\]

Since \( \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} \) is approximately \( 1.095 \), which is greater than \( 1 \):

\[
|x - y + z| \text{ could be } > a.
\]

However, we also need to check if it is strictly bounded by a constant multiple. The key term here is \(\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}}\), which confirms that the expression \( |x - y + z| \) can indeed be greater than or less than \( a \) depending on the values of \(x, y, z\).

### Conclusion

Despite providing a maximum bound of \( |x - y + z| \) through \(\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} a\), we cannot universally say this expression will be equal to, greater than, or less than \(a\) since it relies on specific values of \( x, y, z \). Thus, we can most accurately say that:

**The answer is (A) $\leq$.**
