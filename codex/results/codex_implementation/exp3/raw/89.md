Solution:

## Response

To determine the correct inequality relation for the expression \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc \) under the condition \( a + b + c = 1 \), we can use the identity and inequalities related to symmetric sums and non-negative real numbers.

### Step 1: Apply the Power Mean Inequality

The Power Mean inequality states that:

\[
\sqrt[3]{\frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{3}} \geq \frac{a + b + c}{3}
\]

Given \( a + b + c = 1 \), we have:

\[
\sqrt[3]{\frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{3}} \geq \frac{1}{3}
\]

Cubing both sides yields:

\[
\frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{3} \geq \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{27}
\]

Thus:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \geq \frac{1}{9}
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Term \( 6abc \)

Using the AM-GM inequality:

\[
\frac{a + b + c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies \frac{1}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc}
\]

Cubing gives \( abc \leq \frac{1}{27} \). Therefore:

\[
6abc \leq 6 \cdot \frac{1}{27} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

### Step 3: Combine the Results

Now, we combine the results:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc \geq \frac{1}{9} + 0 = \frac{1}{9}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with \( \frac{1}{3} \)

To complete the comparison with \( \frac{1}{3} \):

\[
\frac{1}{9} < \frac{1}{3}
\]

This implies that:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc < \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

**The answer is (A) $\leq$**.
