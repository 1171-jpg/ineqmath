## Response

To solve this problem, we begin by leveraging the identities and inequalities involving non-negative real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) given that \(a + b + c = 1\).

1. **Using the Power Mean Inequality**:
   The Power Mean Inequality states that for non-negative \(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\) and \(p \geq q\):
   \[
   \left(\frac{x_1^p + x_2^p + ... + x_n^p}{n}\right)^{1/p} \geq \left(\frac{x_1^q + x_2^q + ... + x_n^q}{n}\right)^{1/q}.
   \]
   Specifically, for \(p = 3\) and \(q = 1\), we have:
   \[
   \left(\frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{3}\right)^{1/3} \geq \left(\frac{a + b + c}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{3}.
   \]
   Cubing both sides gives:
   \[
   \frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{3} \geq \frac{1}{27} \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \geq \frac{1}{9}.
   \]

2. **Applying the AM-GM Inequality**:
   By the AM-GM inequality, we know:
   \[
   \frac{a + b + c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \quad \Rightarrow \quad abc \leq \left(\frac{a + b + c}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{27}.
   \]

3. **Analyzing the Expression**:
   The expression \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc\) can be analyzed as follows:
   - From the earlier step, we know \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \geq \frac{1}{9}\).
   - Additionally, since \(abc \leq \frac{1}{27}\), we find that:
   \[
   6abc \leq 6 \cdot \frac{1}{27} = \frac{2}{9}.
   \]
   - Combining gives:
   \[
   a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc \geq \frac{1}{9} + 0 = \frac{1}{9}.
   \]

4. **Final Inequality Comparison**:
   We need to compare \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc\) with \(\frac{1}{3}\):
   \[
   a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc \geq \frac{1}{9} + \frac{2}{9} = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3},
   \]
   which suggests we determine whether:
   \[
   a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc \geq \frac{1}{3}.
   \]

Combining all our results, we conclude that:
- The expression \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc\) is indeed greater than or equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\).

Therefore, the correct relation is:

**Final Answer**:
```
'The answer is (B) ≥'
