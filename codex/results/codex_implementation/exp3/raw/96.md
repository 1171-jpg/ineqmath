## Response

To solve the problem with the given equation \((x+1)(y+2) = 8\) and the expression \(|xy - 10|\), we follow these steps rigorously:

1. **Expand the equation**:
   \[
   xy + 2x + y + 2 = 8
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   xy + 2x + y = 6
   \]

2. **Rearranging**:
   Set \(k = xy\), then we have:
   \[
   k + 2x + y = 6 \quad (1)
   \]
   This indicates that \(y = 6 - k - 2x\). 

3. **Substituting for \(y\)** in the original equation:
   Substituting \(y\) in terms of \(k\) into \(y + 2\):
   \[
   y + 2 = (6 - k - 2x) + 2 = 8 - k - 2x
   \]
   Substituting into \((x+1)(y+2) = 8\):
   \[
   (x + 1)(8 - k - 2x) = 8
   \]

4. **Expanding this equation**:
   \[
   8x + 8 - kx - 2x^2 - (8 - k) = 8
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   -2x^2 + (k - 8)x + 8 - k = 0
   \]

5. **Using the Quadratic Formula**:
   The discriminant must be non-negative for real \(x\):
   \[
   D = (k - 8)^2 - 4 \cdot (-2) \cdot (8 - k) \geq 0
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   D = (k - 8)^2 + 8(8 - k)
   \]
   which expands to:
   \[
   D = k^2 - 16k + 64 + 64 - 8k
   \]
   \[
   D = k^2 - 24k + 128
   \]

6. **Finding roots of discriminant**:
   Setting the discriminant to zero for boundary values:
   \[
   k^2 - 24k + 128 = 0
   \]
   Using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   k = \frac{24 \pm \sqrt{(24)^2 - 4 \cdot 128}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   k = \frac{24 \pm \sqrt{576 - 512}}{2} = \frac{24 \pm \sqrt{64}}{2} = \frac{24 \pm 8}{2}
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   k = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \quad \text{or} \quad k = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

7. **Analyzing \(|xy - 10|\)**:
   The expression we need to analyze is:
   \[
   |k - 10|
   \]
   Given the bounds calculated:
   - When \(k = 16\):
     \[
     |16 - 10| = 6
     \]
   - When \(k = 8\):
     \[
     |8 - 10| = 2
     \]

8. **Setting up the inequality**:
   We know that:
   \[
   |xy - 10| = |k - 10| \quad \text{is}\in [2, 6].
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   |xy - 10| < 7
   \]
   Thus, 

   The answer is:
   ```'The answer is (D) $<$'```
