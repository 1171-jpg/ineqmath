We will evaluate at particular points, notably when \\( x \\) manages to approach critical functions such as behavior near limits or interesting values (0, \\( p \\), and \\( q \\)).\n\n1. **At \\( x = 0 \\)**:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(p+q)(0 + 0 + p^2)}{(p-q)(2(0 - 0 + p^2))} = \\frac{(p+q)p^2}{(p-q)(2p^2)} = \\frac{p+q}{2(p-q)}.\n   \\]\n\n   Thus:\n\n   \\[\n   C \\leq \\frac{p+q}{2(p-q)}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **At \\( x = p \\)**:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(p+q)(p^2 + 2qp + p^2)}{(p-q)(2(p^2 - 2qp + p^2))} = \\frac{(p+q)(2p^2 + 2qp)}{(p-q)(2p^2 - 4qp)} = \\frac{(p+q)(p+q)}{(p-q)(p-q)} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n3. **At \\( x = q \\)** (where \\( q < p \\)):\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(p+q)(2q^2 + 2pq)}{(p-q)(2(q^2 - 2qp + p^2))}.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Assess Bounds\n\nThrough testing multiple values for \\( x \\), we can also assess that the expressions are increasing/decreasing throughout their respective ranges.\n\n### Step 5: Determine Largest \\( C \\)\n\nThe value \\( C \\) will be maximized as we approach the transitions described. \n\nGiven \n\n- At \\( x=0 \\): \\( C \\leq \\frac{p+q}{2(p-q)} \\).\n- At other extreme values determined through testing yield similar expressions, and through evaluating the output we find the limiting behavior resolves towards approaching some maximum function bases.\n\nFrom above, the constant \\( C \\) approaches its maximum determined as \n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{p+q}{2(p-q)}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining these derived values into the required form, we have:\n\n``` \nThe answer is $C=\\frac{p+q}{2(p-q)}$. \n``` \nThus, substituting the boundaries will yield us a concise representation of the bounds, displaying the maximal behavior given \\( p, q > 0 \\).\n\n``` \nThe answer is $C=1$. \n```\n",
