Problem: Let $x, y, z \in [-1, 3]$ such that $x + y + z = 3$. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y, z$:
$$
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq C
\]

holds for all \( x, y, z \in [-1, 3] \) satisfying \( x + y + z = 3 \), we can proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Establish Bounds

Given \( x, y, z \in [-1, 3] \) and the constraint \( x + y + z = 3 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \):

\[
z = 3 - x - y.
\]

The new expression we want to analyze is:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + (3 - x - y)^2.
\]

### Step 2: Expand the Expression

We can expand this expression intuitively:

\[
z^2 = (3 - x - y)^2 = 9 - 6x - 6y + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy.
\]

Thus, our inequality becomes:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + (9 - 6x - 6y + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy) \leq C.
\]

Simplifying further, we get:

\[
2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy - 6x - 6y + 9 \leq C.
\]

This reduces to:

\[
2(x^2 + y^2 + xy) - 6(x + y) + 9 \leq C.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the Critical Conditions

To find the extreme values, we find \( x + y \):

\[
x + y = 3 - z.
\]

We can explore the maximum values of \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) for the valid ranges.

1. If \( x = 3, y + z = 0 \): \((0,0)\).
   \[
   3^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 9.
   \]

2. If \( x + y = 2\) and \( z = 1 \) with \( z = 1 \): 
   - Possible maximum would still be \( 3^2 = 9 \).

3. If \( x = -1, y = 3 \): 
   \[
   (-1)^2 + 3^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 9 + 1 = 11.
   \]

### Step 4: Evaluate Maximum Values

Hence, we analyze:

- Maximum happens either at extremes: look \( x = 3, y + z = 0\) gives \(3\) or for balance \(x= y = 1, z = 1\).

### Step 5: Conclusion

The maximum from our analysis gives us the highest potential value for \( C \). After checking balanced distributions and extremes positions with such constraints, the largest value encountered is \( 11 \).

Thus, we get:

\[
C = 11.
\]

The answer is $C=11$
