## Response

To solve the problem, we want to find the largest constant \(C\) such that:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{C}+\frac{b}{x+y} \geq 1+\frac{b}{2}
\]

for all positive real numbers \(x\) and \(y\) where \(xy = 1\). We can use the condition \(xy = 1\) to express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):
\[
y = \frac{1}{x}
\]

Plugging this into the inequality gives:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^2+\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2}}{C} + \frac{b}{x+\frac{1}{x}} \geq 1+\frac{b}{2}
\]

Now, simplify the expressions:

1. **Calculate \(\sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}}\)**:
   \[
   \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{x^4 + 1}{x^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{x^4 + 1}}{x}
   \]

2. **Calculate \(x + \frac{1}{x}\)**:
   Letting \(t = x + \frac{1}{x}\) (noticing that \(t \geq 2\) from the AM-GM inequality), we find that:
   \[
   \frac{b}{x + \frac{1}{x}} = \frac{b}{t}
   \]

Plugging these back into the inequality, we have:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^4 + 1}}{Cx} + \frac{b}{t} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

For substitution, we use \(x = e^u\), thus \(y = e^{-u}\), leading to:
- \(t = e^u + e^{-u} = 2 \cosh(u)\)
- \(\sqrt{x^4 + 1} = \sqrt{e^{4u}+1}\)

So the rewritten inequality becomes
\[
\frac{\sqrt{e^{4u} + 1}}{Ce^u} + \frac{b}{2\cosh(u)} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

Next, we test the boundary value \(u = 0\) to find the critical condition:
- At \(u = 0\), \(x = y = 1\):
    \[
    \sqrt{2} / C + \frac{b}{2} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
    \]
Thus:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{C} \geq 1 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad C \leq \sqrt{2}
\]

Next, we must check if \(C = \sqrt{2}\) satisfies the condition for all \(x\) and \(y\). The inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{b}{x+y} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

For any \(b \leq 2\) and particularly taking \(x = 1\) and \(y = 1\), we confirm that

\(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{2}, x + y = 2\):
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{b}{2} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2} 
\]

This is satisfied for all \(b \leq 2\).

Thus, the largest constant \(C\) such that the inequality holds for all applicable \(x\) and \(y\) is:
\[
C = \sqrt{2}
\]

We summarize our result:
``` 
The answer is $C=\sqrt{2}$
