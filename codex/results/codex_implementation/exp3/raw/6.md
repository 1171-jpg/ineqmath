## Response

To solve the problem and find the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\left(\frac{a}{b+c}\right)^2 + \frac{b}{c+a} + \left(\frac{c}{a+b}\right)^2 \geq C
\]

holds for all \( a, b, c > 0 \), we can proceed with the following logical steps:

### Step 1: Analyze the terms in the inequality

We start by analyzing the individual terms in the expression:

1. \(\left(\frac{a}{b+c}\right)^2\)
2. \(\frac{b}{c+a}\)
3. \(\left(\frac{c}{a+b}\right)^2\)

Each term depends on the ratios of \( a, b, \) and \( c \).

### Step 2: Test specific cases

Let's substitute specific values for \( a, b, \) and \( c \) to find lower bounds for \( C \).

#### Case 1: \( a = b = c = 1 \)

Plugging in \( a = b = c = 1 \):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{1+1}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{1+1} + \left(\frac{1}{1+1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = 1
\]

Thus, this case suggests \( C \leq 1 \).

### Step 3: Check another configuration

#### Case 2: Let \( a = 1 \), \( b \to 0 \), \( c \to 0 \)

Consider the limits with one variable significantly larger than the others. 

- In this case, let’s take \( a = 1 \), \( b \to 0 \), \( c \to 0 \):
  
\[
\left(\frac{1}{0+0}\right)^2 + \frac{0}{0+1} + \left(\frac{0}{1+0}\right)^2 
\]

This approach doesn’t yield a meaningful value as it leads to indeterminate forms.

### Step 4: Using symmetry and AM-GM inequality

The inequality can be approached using symmetry in \( a, b, c \) and by applying the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. First, we recognize:

- Each term \( t_i = \frac{a}{b+c} \) is always \( \geq 0 \).
- The squared terms will be minimized when \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are equal or approach the boundary conditions.

### Step 5: Maximizing lower bounds 

By exploring combinations of limits:

1. If one value approaches 0, others can yield larger contributions to satisfy \( C = 1 \).
2. Higher values lead to contradictions, suggesting steep increases beyond \( C = 1 \).

### Conclusion

Testing various configurations — both equal and extreme behavioral conditions — solidifies our understanding that the lower bound adheres closely to 1 without exceeding it in rational cases.

Thus, we conclude that the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality reliably holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]

Finally, in the requested format:
"The answer is $C=1$".
