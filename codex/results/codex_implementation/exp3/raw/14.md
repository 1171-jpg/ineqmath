Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we are given the constraint \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 4 \) for non-negative \( a, b, c \). We need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
a + b + c + \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} \leq C
\]

holds true for all non-negative \( a, b, c \) satisfying the given constraint.

### Step 1: Understanding the Constraint
From the constraint \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 4 \):

- This means that the sum of the squares of \( a, b, c \), added to the product \( abc \), equals 4.
- If all three terms are zero, the left side becomes zero, which is valid.

### Step 2: Testing Specific Cases
Let's test some specific values for \( a, b, c \):

#### Case 1: \( a = 2, b = 0, c = 0 \)
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4
\]
Then calculate:
\[
a + b + c + \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} = 2 + 0 + 0 + \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}} = 2 + \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 2 + 1.1547 \approx 3.1547
\]

#### Case 2: \( a = b = c = 1 \)
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
\]
Then calculate:
\[
1 + 1 + 1 + \sqrt{\frac{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}{3}} = 3 + \sqrt{1} = 4
\]

#### Case 3: \( a = b = c = 0 \)
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
\]
Then calculate:
\[
0 + 0 + 0 + \sqrt{\frac{0}{3}} = 0
\]

### Step 3: General Case Exploration
From the test cases:
- From Case 1: \( C \geq 3.1547 \)
- From Case 2: \( C \geq 4 \)
- From Case 3: \( C \geq 0 \)

### Step 4: Finding the Minimum Constant
The maximum value observed from the left-hand side is when \( a = 2, b = 0, c = 0 \) yielding approximately \( 3.1547 \) and the value when \( a = b = c = 1 \) was \( 4 \). 

As such, to satisfy the inequality for all cases:

\[
C = 4
\]

This ensures \( a + b + c + \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} \leq 4 \) holds under the constraint \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 4 \).

### Conclusion
Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all valid \( a, b, c \) is:

```
The answer is $C=4$
