## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the given inequality holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( ab + ac + bc = 3 \).

### Step 1: Understand the Given Inequality

The inequality we need to satisfy is:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{c+a}} \geq \sqrt{\frac{C}{a+b+c+3}}.
\]

### Step 2: Use Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

The left-hand side can be analyzed using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{c+a}} \right)^2 \leq (1 + 1 + 1)\left( \frac{1}{a+b} + \frac{1}{b+c} + \frac{1}{c+a} \right).
\]
This means:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{c+a}} \geq \frac{3}{\sqrt{(a+b) + (b+c) + (c+a)}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2(a+b+c)}}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the Term \( a + b + c + 3 \)

Given the condition \( ab + ac + bc = 3 \), we can use the following relationship:
\[
(ab + ac + bc) \leq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3}.
\]
From this, we can derive that:
\[
a + b + c \geq 3.
\]
Thus, we can analyze the expression \( a + b + c + 3 \):
\[
a + b + c + 3 \geq 6.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the Lower Bound

The left-hand side becomes:
\[
\frac{3}{\sqrt{2(a+b+c)}} \geq \frac{3}{\sqrt{2 \cdot 3}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{6}}.
\]

### Step 5: Find Constants

We now need to find \( C \) such that:
\[
\frac{3}{\sqrt{6}} \geq \sqrt{\frac{C}{6}}.
\]
Squaring both sides leads to:
\[
\frac{9}{6} \geq \frac{C}{6}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
C \leq 9.
\]

### Conclusion

By exploring the case when \( a = b = c = 1 \), we find that the equality holds true, confirming that the upper bound for \( C \) is indeed possible. Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( ab + ac + bc = 3 \) is:
