Problem: Given four real numbers $a, b, c, d \geq 0$ satisfying $a \geq b + 7c + d$, find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$:

$$
7(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a) \geq C a b c d
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve for the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
7(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a) \geq C a b c d
\]

holds for all \( a, b, c, d \geq 0 \) and under the condition \( a \geq b + 7c + d \), we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Evaluate at Edge Cases 

Consider the edge cases where some of the variables are set to zero to simplify the inequalities.

#### Case 1: Let \( b = c = d = 0 \)

In this case, the condition simplifies to:

\[
a \geq 0
\]

The inequality becomes:

\[
7(a + 0)(0 + 0)(0 + 0)(0 + a) \geq C a \cdot 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
0 \geq 0
\]

which holds for all \( a \). This case doesn't provide information on \( C \).

#### Case 2: Let \( a = b = c = d = t \) for \( t \geq 0 \)

Now, the condition simplifies to:

\[
t \geq t + 7t + t
\]

This clearly isn't valid except for \( t = 0 \).

#### Case 3: Let \( a = 7, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0 \)

Then the condition simplifies to:

\[
7 \geq 0
\]

The inequality becomes:

\[
7(7 + 0)(0 + 0)(0 + 0)(0 + 7) \geq C \cdot 7 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
0 \geq 0
\]

Again, this does not provide information on \( C \).

### Step 2: Utilize the Condition

We can use the condition \( a \geq b + 7c + d \) to enforce certain values.

Let’s select \( b = 0 \), \( c = 1 \), and \( d = 0 \), which gives:

\[
a \geq 7
\]

Substituting, we get:

\[
7(a + 0)(0 + 1)(1 + 0)(0 + a) \geq C a \cdot 0 \cdot 1 \cdot 0
\]

This again results in no useful information.

### Step 3: Viable Combination 

Let's try \( b = 1, c = 1, d = 1 \) and maximize \( a = 7 + 1 + 7 \cdot 1 + 1 = 16 \).


#### Final Evaluation 

Now consider:

\[
(7 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 7)
\]

Calculating step by step, we get:

\[
= 8 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 8 = 256
\]

And we need to evaluate 

\[
C = 7 \cdot a \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 7 \cdot 16 = 112
\]

From this, we can determine the value of \( C \):

### Result 

The maximal value found for \( C \) given the conditions of the problem is:

\[
\boxed{112}
\]

Therefore,

```plaintext
The answer is $C=112$
```
