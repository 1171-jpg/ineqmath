Problem: Let $a > 1$ be a real number. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the following inequality holds:
$$
\frac{a^n-1}{n} \geq C\sqrt{a}^{n+1}-\sqrt{a}^{n-1}.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{a^n - 1}{n} \geq C \sqrt{a}^{n+1} - \sqrt{a}^{n-1}
\]

holds for all \( n \in \mathbb{N} \), we'll start by analyzing both sides of the inequality.

### Step 1: Simplify the Left Side

The left side can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{a^n - 1}{n}
\]

For large \( n \), \( a^n \) grows significantly larger than 1, so we can approximate:

\[
\frac{a^n - 1}{n} \approx \frac{a^n}{n}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Right Side

The right side can be rewritten as:

\[
C \sqrt{a}^{n+1} - \sqrt{a}^{n-1} = C a^{(n+1)/2} - a^{(n-1)/2}
\]

### Step 3: Marginalize the Terms

For large \( n \), we will again approximate:

\[
C a^{(n+1)/2} - a^{(n-1)/2} \approx C a^{(n+1)/2}
\]

### Step 4: Compare the Growth Rates

Now we need to establish the conditions under which the growth rates of both approximately equal each other. That is, we want:

\[
\frac{a^n}{n} \geq C a^{(n+1)/2}
\]

This can be manipulated as follows:

\[
a^n \geq C n a^{(n+1)/2}
\]

Dividing both sides by \( a^{(n+1)/2} \):

\[
a^{n/2 - 1/2} \geq C n
\]

### Step 5: Limit Analysis

Taking the logarithm (which preserves the order since \( a > 1 \)), we get:

\[
\frac{n}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \ln a \geq \ln C + \ln n
\]

### Step 6: Establish Bounds

For large \( n \), \( \frac{n}{2} \) dominates \( \ln n \), which implies:

\[
\frac{n}{2} \geq \ln n + \frac{1}{2} \ln a + \ln C
\]

As \( n \to \infty\), \( \frac{1}{2} \ln a + \ln C \) must then converge to zero, which leads to the consideration of \( C \):

We require this to hold, thus ensuring:

\[
C \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

### Conclusion: Maximum Value of C

The largest constant \( C \) for which the inequality holds for all \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) is:

\[
C = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, we write:

```
The answer is $C=\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}$
```
