## Response

To solve the problem of finding the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\frac{a^n - 1}{n} \geq C\sqrt{a}^{n+1} - \sqrt{a}^{n-1}
\]

holds for all \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) (where \( a > 1 \)), we need to analyze both sides of the inequality.

### Step 1: Analyzing the left-hand side

The left-hand side is:

\[
\frac{a^n - 1}{n}.
\]

As \( n \) becomes large, we can use L'Hôpital's Rule or the asymptotic form of \( a^n \) to show:

\[
\frac{a^n - 1}{n} \sim \frac{a^n}{n} \text{ as } n \to \infty.
\]

### Step 2: Analyzing the right-hand side

The right-hand side can be simplified as follows:

\[
C\sqrt{a}^{n+1} - \sqrt{a}^{n-1} = C a^{(n+1)/2} - a^{(n-1)/2}.
\]

### Step 3: Comparing both sides

Now, we have to ensure:

\[
\frac{a^n}{n} \geq C a^{(n+1)/2} - a^{(n-1)/2}.
\]

### Step 4: Dividing both sides by \( a^{(n-1)/2} \)

Let’s divide both sides by \( a^{(n-1)/2} \):

\[
\frac{a^{n - (n-1)/2}}{n a^{(n-1)/2}} \geq C a^{1/2} - 1.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{a^{(n+1)/2}}{n} \geq C a^{1/2} - 1.
\]

### Step 5: Rearranging the inequality

Rearranging gives us:

\[
C a^{1/2} \leq \frac{a^{(n+1)/2}}{n} + 1.
\]

As \( n \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{a^{(n+1)/2}}{n} \) approaches infinity, ensuring we can find bounds on \( C \).

### Step 6: Finding limits on \( C \)

Let’s analyze the limit when \( n \) gets large. Using the properties of limits, we notice:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \left( \frac{a^{(n+1)/2}}{n} \right) = \infty.
\]

### Step 7: Finding precise bounds for \( C \)

Now we seek to optimize the constant \( C \). Since the right-hand side grows as \( n \) increases, we can set \( C \) as follows:

1. Equate leading coefficients on both sides.
  
By matching terms, we see:

\[
C = 1
\]

### Conclusion

Combining all observations, we find:

\[
C \leq 1.
\]

The largest constant \( C \) satisfying the inequality for all \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) is indeed \( C = 1 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

```
The answer is $C=1$
