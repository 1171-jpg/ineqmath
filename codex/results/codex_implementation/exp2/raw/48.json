    "response": "To solve the problem, we start with the given constraints and look for the smallest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality \n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all \\( x, y, z \\in [-1, 3] \\) with the condition that \\( x + y + z = 3 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Use the constraint\n\nFrom the constraint \\( x + y + z = 3 \\), we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two. Let's express \\( z \\):\n\n\\[\nz = 3 - x - y\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Substitute into the inequality\n\nSubstituting for \\( z \\), we rewrite \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + (3 - x - y)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding the squared term:\n\n\\[\n= x^2 + y^2 + (9 - 6x - 6y + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy)\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms gives:\n\n\\[\n= 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy - 6x - 6y + 9\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of bounds\n\nNow, we need to analyze \\( 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy - 6x - 6y + 9 \\). To find the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that maximize this expression under the constraints \\( -1 \\leq x, y \\leq 3 \\) and \\( x + y \\leq 3 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate boundary cases\n\nTo find the maximum, we can test combinations of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) at the boundary of the allowed values:\n\n1. **Case 1**: \\( x = 3, y = 0 \\) (which gives \\( z = 0 \\)):\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Case 2**: \\( x = 0, y = 3 \\) (which gives \\( z = 0 \\)):\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 0^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Case 3**: \\( x = 1, y = 1 \\) (which gives \\( z = 1 \\)):\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3\n   \\]\n  \n4. **Case 4**: \\( x = -1, y = 5 \\) (not valid since \\( y \\) exceeds 3).\n\n5. **Case 5**: \\( x = 3, y = -1 \\) (which gives \\( z = 1 \\)):\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2 = 9 + 1 + 1 = 11\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Conclude \n\nFrom checking these boundary values, the maximum value we found was 11 when \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( y = -1 \\).\n\n### Answer\n\nThus, the smallest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all valid \\( x, y, z \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\textbf{The answer is } C = 11.\n\\]\n",
