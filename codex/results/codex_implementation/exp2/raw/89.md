## Response

To solve the given inequality problem, we need to analyze the expression \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc \) given the constraint \( a + b + c = 1 \).

### Step 1: Application of the Power Mean Inequality
According to the Power Mean Inequality, for non-negative real numbers \( a, b, c \):

\[
\frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{3} \geq \left(\frac{a + b + c}{3}\right)^3
\]

Given \( a + b + c = 1 \), we have:

\[
\frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{3} \geq \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{27}
\]

### Step 2: Rearranging the Inequality
Multiplying through by 3 gives:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \geq \frac{1}{9}
\]

### Step 3: Applying the AM-GM Inequality
Next, apply the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality to \( a, b, c \):

\[
\frac{a + b + c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies \frac{1}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies abc \leq \frac{1}{27}
\]

### Step 4: Estimating \( 6abc \)
From the above, we know:

\[
6abc \leq 6 \cdot \frac{1}{27} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

### Step 5: Combining the Results
Adding these inequalities together:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc \geq \frac{1}{9} + \frac{2}{9} = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Conclusion
This shows that:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc \geq \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

```plaintext
'The answer is (B) ≥'
```
