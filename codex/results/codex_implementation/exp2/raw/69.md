## Response

To solve the given problem, we need to analyze the expressions \( a^3 + b^3 + 2c^3 \) and \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \) under the constraint \( abc = 1 \) with \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+} \).

### Steps

1. **Using AM-GM Inequality**:
   - Let's apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms \( a^3, b^3, \) and \( 2c^3 \):
   \[
   \frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + c^3}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{a^3 \cdot b^3 \cdot c^3 \cdot c^3} = \sqrt[4]{a^3b^3c^6}
   \]
   Using \( abc = 1 \) implies \( c = \frac{1}{ab} \). Therefore, \( abc = 1 \Rightarrow c^3 = \frac{1}{a^3b^3} \).
   Plugging this into the inequality gives us:
   \[
   a^3 + b^3 + 2c^3 \geq 4 \sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{(ab)^3} \cdot (ab)^{-3}} = 4 \sqrt[4]{1} = 4
   \]

2. **Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**:
   - For \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \):
   \[
   (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(1 + 1 + 1) \geq (a + b + c)^2
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq \frac{(a + b + c)^2}{3}
   \]

3. **Inequality transformation**:
   - From previous observations, for \( abc = 1 \), we can say \( c = \frac{1}{ab} \), leading us to relate \( a, b, c \) through their respective sums and find comparable expressions.

4. **Examining Cases**:
   - When \( a = b = c = 1 \):
   \[
   a^3 + b^3 + 2c^3 = 1 + 1 + 2 \cdot 1 = 4
   \]
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   \]
   Here, \( 4 \) is clearly greater than \( 3 \).

5. **Generalization**:
   - Thus, we can analyze that generally for any \( a, b, c > 0 \) with \( abc = 1 \):
   \[
   a^3 + b^3 + 2c^3 \text{ tends to be } \geq a^2 + b^2 + c^2 
   \]

### Conclusion
From our analyses, we conclude:

The correct relation for the expressions \( a^3 + b^3 + 2c^3 \) and \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \) under the condition \( abc = 1 \) is:
\[
a^3 + b^3 + 2c^3 \geq a^2 + b^2 + c^2
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

```
'The answer is (B) ≥'
```
