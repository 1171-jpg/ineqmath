## Response

To solve the problem, we want to find the maximum constant \( C \) such that:

\[
\frac{1}{1+a^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+b)} + \frac{1}{1+c^2} \geq C
\]

given the constraint \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \) where \( a, b, c \geq 0 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Terms

1. **Term Analysis:**
   - \( \frac{1}{1+a^2} \) decreases as \( a \) increases.
   - \( \frac{1}{3(1+b)} \) decreases as \( b \) increases.
   - \( \frac{1}{1+c^2} \) decreases as \( c \) increases.

### Step 2: Identify Boundary Conditions

Let's explore the scenarios where the values of \( a, b, c \) take extreme values under the given constraint:

1. **Case 1**: Let \( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{1+1^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+0)} + \frac{1}{1+0^2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + 1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + 1 = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{6}{6} = \frac{11}{6}
   \]

2. **Case 2**: Let \( a = 0, b = 1, c = 0 \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{1+0^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+1)} + \frac{1}{1+0^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{6} + 1 = 2 + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{13}{6}
   \]

3. **Case 3**: Let \( a = 0, b = 0, c = 1 \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{1+0^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+0)} + \frac{1}{1+1^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{3}{6} = 1 + \frac{5}{6} = \frac{11}{6}
   \]

### Step 3: Minimum Value Found

From the explored cases:
- The value obtained from \( a=1, b=0, c=0 \) yields \( \frac{11}{6} \).
- The value obtained from \( a=0, b=1, c=0 \) yields \( \frac{13}{6} \).

The smallest value is \( \frac{11}{6} \).

### Step 4: Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c \) subject to the constraints is:

\[
C = \frac{11}{6}
\]

Finally, the answer is:

```
'The answer is $C=\frac{11}{6}$'
