Problem: Let $a, b, c \geq 0$ and $a^2 + b + c^2 = 1$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:

## Response

To solve the problem, we want to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{1}{1+a^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+b)} + \frac{1}{1+c^2} \geq C
\]

holds for all \( a, b, c \geq 0 \) satisfying \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \).

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Understand and Analyze the Equation**: We start with the constraint \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \). The variables \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) can take values from \( 0 \) to \( 1 \) while respecting this equation.

2. **Substitution for Extreme Cases**:
   - The scenario where \( a = 0 \) and \( b + c^2 = 1 \). Setting \( b = 1 \) and \( c = 0 \) achieves extents as multiple combinations can exist:
     - If \( a = 0 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 0 \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{1+0^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+1)} + \frac{1}{1+0^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{6} + 1 = \frac{7}{6}.
     \]

3. **Exploring More Cases**:
   - Consider setting \( c = 0 \) for simplicity:
     - If \( b = 0 \), then \( a^2 = 1 \) giving extremes:
     \[
     \frac{1}{1+1} + \frac{1}{3(1+0)} + \frac{1}{1+0} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + 1 = \frac{11}{6}.
     \]
   - If \( a=0, c=1 \) and \( b=0 \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{1+0^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+0)} + \frac{1}{1+1} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 + \frac{5}{6} = \frac{11}{6}.
     \]

4. **Consider General Values**: Next, we test edge cases where \( a = c = 0 \):
   - Setting \( b = 1 \): 
   \[
   \frac{1}{1+0} + \frac{1}{3(2)} + \frac{1}{1+0} = 1 + \frac{1}{6} + 1 = \frac{7}{6}.
   \]

5. **Find Minimum**: The lowest established value is by analyzing the combinations performed which can assume the smallest case of \( \frac{2}{3} + 1 \) leading to \( 1, 0, 0 \), holding:
   \[
   \ge \frac{11}{6}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The maximum constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality across the determined scenarios is:

\[
C = \frac{11}{6}.
\]

Thus, the answer format requested is:
```
'TThe answer is $C=\frac{11}{6}$'
