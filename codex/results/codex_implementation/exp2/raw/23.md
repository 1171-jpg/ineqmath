Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to establish the maximal constant \( C \) for the inequality 

\[
\frac{a}{1+2 b^3}+\frac{b}{1+2 c^3}+\frac{c}{1+2 a^3} \geq C
\]

given \( a + b + c = 3 \) and \( a, b, c > 0 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Inequality

We begin by testing some specific cases to help find the constant \( C \).

1. **Case where \( a = b = c = 1 \)**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1^3} + \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1^3} + \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1^3} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1
   \]
   Hence, in this case, we have:
   \[
   \frac{a}{1 + 2b^3} + \frac{b}{1 + 2c^3} + \frac{c}{1 + 2a^3} = 1.
   \]
   This suggests \( C \leq 1 \).

### Step 2: Find a Potential \( C \) Using Symmetry

Assuming the maximum occurs at the symmetric point \( a = b = c = 1 \), let’s check whether \( C = 1 \) can be achieved for other combinations.

2. **Case where one variable approaches 0**: Let \( a = 3 - \epsilon \), \( b = \epsilon \), \( c = 0 \) with \( \epsilon \rightarrow 0 \):
   \[
   \frac{3 - \epsilon}{1 + 2 \cdot 0^3} + \frac{\epsilon}{1 + 2(0)^3} + 0 = 3 - \epsilon
   \]
   As \( \epsilon \rightarrow 0 \), \( 3 - \epsilon \rightarrow 3 \) which does not aid in determining \( C \).

### Step 3: Using Jensen's Inequality

Observe \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + 2x^3} \). It's concave down for \( x > 0 \):
\[
f''(x) < 0 \text{ (concave down)},
\]
which allows us to use Jensen's inequality:
\[
f(a) + f(b) + f(c) \geq 3f\left(\frac{a + b + c}{3}\right)
\]
Substituting \( a + b + c = 3 \):
\[
f(1) = \frac{1}{3} \implies \frac{a}{1+2b^3} + \frac{b}{1+2c^3} + \frac{c}{1+2a^3} \geq 1
\]

### Summary and Conclusion

All tests point towards \( C = 1 \) being the critical constant for the inequality.

Hence, we conclude that the maximal constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) with \( a + b + c = 3 \) is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]

Thus, we express our final answer as required:
