Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximal constant \( C \) such that the following inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a + b + c = 3 \):

\[
\frac{a}{1 + 2b^3} + \frac{b}{1 + 2c^3} + \frac{c}{1 + 2a^3} \geq C.
\]

### Step 1: Analyzing the Function

First, we can analyze the structure of the left side of the inequality. The terms \( \frac{a}{1 + 2b^3} \), \( \frac{b}{1 + 2c^3} \), and \( \frac{c}{1 + 2a^3} \) suggest that as the variables \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) increase, each ratio decreases due to the presence of the \( 2b^3 \), \( 2c^3 \), and \( 2a^3 \) terms in the denominators.

### Step 2: Employing Symmetry

Since \( a, b, c \) are positive and symmetric in the expression, we can test the cases when \( a = b = c \). Let's set:

\[
a = b = c = 1.
\]

Now, substituting these values into the inequality:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1^3} + \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1^3} + \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1^3} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{1 + 2} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1.
\]

This observation gives us a candidate for \( C \):
\[
C \leq 1.
\]

### Step 3: Finding the Lower Bound

Next, we need to check if \( C = 1 \) is achievable for all \( a, b, c \). We rearrange the original expression and need to prove:

\[
\frac{a}{1 + 2b^3} + \frac{b}{1 + 2c^3} + \frac{c}{1 + 2a^3} \geq 1.
\]

### Step 4: Using Jensen's Inequality

Since the function \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + 2x^3} \) is concave for positive values (which can be checked using the second derivative test), Jensen's Inequality applies here. Thus, we can write:

\[
f(a) + f(b) + f(c) \geq 3f\left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right) = 3f(1) = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the inequality \(\frac{a}{1 + 2b^3} + \frac{b}{1 + 2c^3} + \frac{c}{1 + 2a^3} \geq 1\) holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) summing to 3.

Finally, we conclude that the maximal value of \( C \) for which the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a + b + c = 3 \) is:

\[
\text{"The answer is $C=1$"}
