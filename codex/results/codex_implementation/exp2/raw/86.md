## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression:

\[
E = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{2x^2 + 1} + \frac{y^2 - z^2}{2y^2 + 1} + \frac{z^2 - x^2}{2z^2 + 1}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze Each Term

Consider a general term of the form:

\[
\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a^2 + 1}
\]

This can be rewritten using the identity \(a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)\):

\[
\frac{(a-b)(a+b)}{2a^2 + 1}
\]

This term presents both **positive and negative values** depending on whether \(a > b\) or \(a < b\).

### Step 2: Each Pairwise Comparison

To analyze the summation of the three terms:

1. **If \( x = y = z \)**: 
   - All terms become zero, leading to \(E = 0\).

2. **If \( x \neq y \), \( y \neq z \), and \( z \neq x \)**:
   - Each term contributes positively or negatively depending on the relative sizes of \(x, y, z\).

### Step 3: Boundaries Analysis

We can examine extreme cases:

- For large values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
  - The fraction tends to 1 as the squares dominate past the linear terms.
  
- For small values:
  - Analyzing limits approaching zero can reveal behavior but should keep in mind continuity and boundedness.

### Step 4: Putting It Together

Using symmetry and operational properties of the fractions, we can infer that each individual term contributes a bounded amount (greater than 0) or diminishes to zero, depending on the arrangement of values:

1. **Each term \( \frac{x^2 - y^2}{2x^2 + 1} \)** is effectively controlling the influence between \(x\) and \(y\), allowing us to conclude that in symmetric distributions (where \(x, y, z\) approach average), the overall relationship would balance.

Using numerical or graphical methods could substantiate values but can confidently arrive at the conclusion based on inequality theories of continuous functions on reals.

### Final Comparison

Consequently, the overall behavior suggests that:

\[
E \leq 0
\]

Thus, we choose the relation:

\[
\text{The answer is (A) } \leq
\]
