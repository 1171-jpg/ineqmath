## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given equation and the inequality. 

### Given Equation
We have the condition:

\[
(x+1)(y+2) = 8
\]

### Rewrite the Equation
Expanding the left-hand side gives:

\[
xy + 2x + y + 2 = 8
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
xy + 2x + y = 6
\]

### We Need to Relate \(xy\) to 10
We want to determine the relation of \( |xy - 10| \) to 7. Thus, we need to analyze \( xy \).

### Express \( xy \)
Rearranging gives:

\[
xy = 6 - 2x - y
\]

Our goal is to find values for \( xy \) that satisfy the equation \( |xy - 10| \).

### Find Maximum and Minimum Values of \( xy \)

To maximize or minimize \( xy \), we can denote \( x+1 \) as \( a \) and \( y+2 \) as \( b \), transforming the equation into:

\[
ab = 8
\]

From this, we can express \( y \) as:

\[
y = \frac{8}{x+1} - 2
\]

Substituting this back into the equation for \( xy \):

\[
xy = x\left(\frac{8}{x+1} - 2\right) = \frac{8x}{x+1} - 2x
\]

The function \( xy \) depends on \( x \). To explore the bounds, we can use \( ab = 8 \) with known values for \( a \) and \( b \).

### Setting the Product Equal to 8
Let \( a = m \) and \( b = \frac{8}{m} \):

The expression becomes:

\[
xy = (m-1)\left(\frac{8}{m} - 2\right) = \frac{8(m-1)}{m} - 2(m-1) = \frac{8(m-1) - 2m(m-1)}{m}
\]

### Consider the Boundaries
We know \( (x+1)(y+2) = 8\) can take values that cover the product form. From the AM-GM Inequality:

\[
\frac{x+1 + y+2}{2} \geq \sqrt{(x+1)(y+2)} \implies \frac{x+1 + y+2}{2} \geq \sqrt{8}
\]

Thus, 

\[
x + y \geq 2\sqrt{8} - 3
\]

### Finding \( |xy - 10| \)
The maximum and minimum values of \( xy \):

1. For the case \( xy = 10 \), we get the boundary \( |10 - 10| = 0\).
2. Evaluating conditions will involve setting the boundary:

Evaluating:

\[
|xy - 10| \text{ vs } 7
\]

### Final Decisions
As we approach analyzing the cases:

- If \( xy < 10 \) implies 
  \[
  |xy - 10| < 7 \Longrightarrow xy < 3 \text{ or } xy > 17
  \]
- Confirming boundaries, we find \( |xy - 10| \) must be \( < 7 \), which implies:

\[
|xy - 10| < 7 \Rightarrow \text{(A)} \leq
\]

### Conclusion
The relation holds true:
