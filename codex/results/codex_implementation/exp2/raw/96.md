Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the equation given:

\[
(x + 1)(y + 2) = 8
\]

We can expand this equation:

\[
xy + 2x + y + 2 = 8
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
xy + 2x + y = 6
\]

Next, we need to analyze the expression:

\[
|xy - 10|
\]

We want to find the relation between \( |xy - 10| \) and \( 7 \). 

### Step 1: Setting up the inequality

This can be rewritten as two inequalities:

\[
-7 < xy - 10 < 7 
\]

This transforms into:

1. \( xy - 10 < 7 \implies xy < 17 \)
2. \( xy - 10 > -7 \implies xy > 3 \)

Thus, we have:

\[
3 < xy < 17
\]

### Step 2: Exploring the boundaries

Using the relation \( xy + 2x + y = 6 \):
We rewrite \( xy \):

\[
xy = 6 - 2x - y
\]

Given that \( (x + 1)(y + 2) = 8 \), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[
y + 2 = \frac{8}{x + 1} \implies y = \frac{8}{x + 1} - 2
\]

Substituting \( y \) back into \( xy \):

Substituting into \( xy \):

\[
xy = x\left(\frac{8}{x + 1} - 2\right) = \frac{8x}{x + 1} - 2x
\]

Simplifying this gives:

\[
xy = \frac{8x - 2x(x + 1)}{x + 1} = \frac{8x - 2x^2 - 2x}{x + 1}
\]

\[
xy = \frac{-2x^2 + 6x}{x + 1} = \frac{-2x^2 + 6x}{x + 1}
\]

### Step 3: Analyzing the critical points

Now we can analyze the range of \( xy \):

1. **Finding critical points:**
   - Set \( -2x^2 + 6x = 3 \):
   \[
   -2x^2 + 6x - 3 = 0
   \]
   Solving this yields:
   \[
   x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 24}}{-4} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{12}}{-4} = \frac{6 \mp 2\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{3 \mp \sqrt{3}}{2}
   \]

2. **Analyzing intervals for maximum and minimum**:
   - Values can be determined using \( (x+1)(y+2) = 8 \).

### Conclusion

Through testing values, we find \( xy \) can indeed achieve higher than \( 3 \) and lower than \( 17 \). Therefore evaluating the region gives:

\[
|xy - 10| < 7 \implies xy \text{ indeed fits: }
\]

Thus the relation that fits in the blank is:

\[
|xy - 10| < 7
\]

### Final Answer

Based on our deductions:

'The answer is (D) <'
