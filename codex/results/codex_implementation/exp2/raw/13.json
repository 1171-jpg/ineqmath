    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality given:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1+\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{1}{y}\\right) \\geq C\n\\]\n\nwith the constraint that \\(x + y = 1\\) for positive real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Rewrite the Inequality:**\n   Start by expanding the left-hand side of the inequality:\n\n   \\[\n   \\left(1+\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{1}{y}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{xy}\n   \\]\n\n   Now substituting \\(y = 1 - x\\):\n\n   \\[\n   1 + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{1 - x} + \\frac{1}{x(1 - x)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the Expression:**\n   The expression becomes:\n\n   \\[\n   1 + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{1 - x} + \\frac{1}{x(1 - x)} = 1 + \\frac{(1-x) + x}{x(1 - x)} + \\frac{1}{x(1 - x)}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying further yields:\n\n   \\[\n   1 + \\frac{1}{x(1 - x)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the Minimum Value:**\n   We need to minimize the expression \\(1 + \\frac{1}{x(1-x)}\\). The term \\(\\frac{1}{x(1-x)}\\) can be simplified by transform into a single variable.\n\n4. **Using AM-GM Inequality:**\n   The product \\(xy\\) is maximized when \\(x = y\\). Given \\(x + y = 1\\), we can set \\(x = y = \\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n   \\[\n   xy = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore:\n\n   \\[\n   1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 1 + 4 = 5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Evaluating \\(C\\):**\n   The value of \\(1 + \\frac{1}{xy}\\) yields its minimum as \\(5\\). Thus, at the point where \\(x = y = \\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right) = (1 + 2)(1 + 2) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\geq C\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the largest constant \\(C\\) that satisfies this inequality is:\n\n   \\[\n   C = 5\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nTo state the answer in the required format:\n\n```\n'The answer is $C=5$'\n```\n",
