## Response

Let's analyze the given expression and inequality step by step.

We need to evaluate the inequality:

\[
\sqrt{abc} + \sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \quad () \quad 1
\]

where \( a, b, c \in (0, 1) \).

### Step 1: Analyze the terms

1. **Term 1: \( \sqrt{abc} \)**

   Since \( a, b, c \in (0, 1) \), we know that:
   \[
   0 < abc < 1 \implies 0 < \sqrt{abc} < 1
   \]

2. **Term 2: \( \sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \)**

   Since \( a, b, c \in (0, 1) \), it follows that \( 1-a, 1-b, 1-c \) are also in the range \( (0, 1) \). Therefore:
   \[
   0 < (1-a)(1-b)(1-c) < 1 \implies 0 < \sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} < 1
   \]

### Step 2: Combine the terms

When we add these two terms, we have:

\[
\sqrt{abc} + \sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} < 1 + 1 = 2
\]

### Step 3: Determine bounds

Now let's examine the specific maximum value for the sum \( \sqrt{abc} + \sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \):

- The maximum value for each square root term is \( 1 \), but they can't each reach \( 1 \) simultaneously because of their strict inequalities (since if one is nearing 1, the other must be nearing 0).

Thus, their exact sum could be at most close to \( 1 \) but never equal to or exceed \( 1 \).

### Step 4: Conclusion

Based on these observations:

- When \( a, b, c \) take extreme values (close to 0 or 1), the sum \( \sqrt{abc} + \sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \) approaches \( 1 \) but doesn't equal or exceed \( 1 \). 

Hence, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
\sqrt{abc} + \sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} < 1
\]

Thus, the answer is:

```
'The answer is (D) <'
