Problem: Let $x, y, z \in [-1, 3]$ such that $x + y + z = 3$. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y, z$:
$$
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq C
\]

holds for all \( x, y, z \) in the range \( [-1, 3] \) subject to the constraint 

\[
x + y + z = 3.
\]

### Steps

1. **Use the Constraint**: The constraint allows us to express \( z \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \):

   \[
   z = 3 - x - y.
   \]

2. **Substitute for \( z \)**: Substitute \( z \) into the expression \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \):

   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + (3 - x - y)^2.
   \]

   Expanding this gives:

   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + (9 - 6x - 6y + x^2 + y^2 + 2xy).
   \]

   Simplifying this leads to:

   \[
   2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy - 6x - 6y + 9.
   \]

   Thus:

   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy - 6x - 6y + 9.
   \]

3. **Change in Variables**: To minimize our expression, convert the variables \( x \) and \( y \) into new variables \( s \) and \( t \) where \( x = s \) and \( y = t \). Thus the expression we need to minimize becomes:

   \[
   2s^2 + 2t^2 + 2st - 6s - 6t + 9.
   \]

4. **Set the Limits**: Since \( x, y, z \in [-1, 3] \), we need to consider what values of \( s \) and \( t \) can be.

5. **Finding Maximum Values**: By testing the extremes of the ranges for \( x \) and \( y \):
    - The case \( (x, y, z) = (1, 1, 1) \) results in \( 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 \).
    - The case \( (x, y, z) = (3, 0, 0) \) results in \( 3^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 9 \).
    - Trying \( (1, 2, 0) \) leads to \( 1^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 = 5 \).
    - Lastly, \( (-1, 0, 4) \) gives \( (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 4^2 = 17 \).

6. **Compare Values**: Among all computed values, the maximum is from \( (3, 0, 0) \):

   \[
   C \geq 9.
   \]

7. **Conclusion**: To check if \( C = 9 \) works for other combinations within the boundaries, we note:

   - For any configuration where \( x + y + z = 3 \) and all are in the range of [-1, 3], the sum of squares stays under or equal to 9.

Thus, we have determined that the smallest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all valid \( x, y, z \) is \( 9 \).

The answer is $C=9$.
