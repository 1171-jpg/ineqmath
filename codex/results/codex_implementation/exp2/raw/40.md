## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given inequality:

\[
\frac{a+1}{a+b+1}+\frac{b+1}{b+c+1}+\frac{c+1}{c+a+1} \geq C
\]

under the constraint \(a + b + c = 3\) and \(a, b, c \geq 0\). Our goal is to find the largest constant \(C\) that satisfies the inequality for all non-negative values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

### Step 1: Simplifying the Expression

Each individual fraction can be analyzed separately:

\[
\frac{a+1}{a+b+1} = 1 - \frac{b}{a+b+1}
\]

This shows that the original expression can be rewritten as:

\[
3 - \left( \frac{b}{a+b+1} + \frac{c}{b+c+1} + \frac{a}{c+a+1} \right)
\]

Thus, we need the inequality:

\[
3 - \left( \frac{b}{a+b+1} + \frac{c}{b+c+1} + \frac{a}{c+a+1} \right) \geq C
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\frac{b}{a+b+1} + \frac{c}{b+c+1} + \frac{a}{c+a+1} \leq 3 - C
\]

### Step 2: Finding a Bound for Each Term

Now we will analyze the upper bound of the sum of fractions:

1. The expression \(\frac{b}{a+b+1} + \frac{c}{b+c+1} + \frac{a}{c+a+1} \) remains bounded above because:
   - Each term \(\frac{x}{y}\) where \(x \leq 3\) and \(y\) is also related to \(x\) cannot exceed \(1\).
   - Thus, each fraction is at most \(1\) (but can be less depending on the values of \(a, b, c\)).

### Step 3: Testing Specific Values

To assert the bound:

- Let \(a = b = c = 1\):
  
\[
\frac{1+1}{1+1+1} + \frac{1+1}{1+1+1} + \frac{1+1}{1+1+1} = 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2
\]

This indicates that the total of the expression can reach \(2\), which means:

\[
C \leq 2
\]

### Step 4: Testing for Optimality

As we suspect \(C=2\) is optimal, we can test values where one variable is significantly larger than the others.

- Set \(a = 3\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 0\):

\[
\frac{3+1}{3+0+1} + 0 + 0 = \frac{4}{4} = 1
\]

- Alternatively, test \(a = 2\), \(b = 1\), \(c = 0\):

\[
\frac{2+1}{2+1+1} + \frac{1+1}{1+0+1} + 0 = \frac{3}{4} + 1 = 1.75
\]

Both tests return values less than \(2\).

### Conclusion

After testing various distributions and confirming the bounds do not exceed when organized appropriately, we conclude:

\[
C = 2
\]

Thus, the largest constant \(C\) for which the inequality holds under the given conditions is:
