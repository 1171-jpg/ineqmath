Problem: Find the smallest constant $C$ such that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, the following inequality holds:
$$
x^2 + x + y^2 + y + C \geq x y
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality \( x^2 + x + y^2 + y + C \geq xy \), let's rearrange some terms for a clearer view:

\[
x^2 - xy + y^2 + x + y + C \geq 0
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the Quadratic Expression

The left-hand side can be treated as a quadratic in \( x \):

\[
x^2 - xy + (y^2 + x + y + C) \geq 0
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Discriminant

For the quadratic to be non-negative for all \( x \), the discriminant must be less than or equal to zero. The discriminant \( D \) of the quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by:

\[
D = b^2 - 4ac
\]

In our case:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -y \)
- \( c = y^2 + x + y + C \)

Thus, the discriminant becomes:

\[
D = (-y)^2 - 4(1)(y^2 + y + C) = y^2 - 4(y^2 + y + C)
\]

Expanding gives:

\[
D = y^2 - 4y^2 - 4y - 4C = -3y^2 - 4y - 4C
\]

### Step 3: Ensure the Discriminant is Non-positive

To ensure the expression is non-negative for all \( y \), we need:

\[
-3y^2 - 4y - 4C \leq 0
\]

This must hold for all \( y \). Therefore, we analyze the expression:

\[
-3y^2 - 4y - 4C \text{ does not have real roots}.
\]

### Step 4: Finding the Condition on \( C \)

The quadratic \( -3y^2 - 4y - 4C \) will not have real roots if its discriminant is less than or equal to zero. For our quadratic:

\[
(-4)^2 - 4(-3)(-4C) \leq 0
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
16 - 12C \leq 0
\]

Rearranging leads to:

\[
12C \geq 16
\]

Dividing by 12 gives:

\[
C \geq \frac{16}{12} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all \( x \) and \( y \) is:

\[
C = \frac{4}{3}
\]

So, the final answer is:

'"'The answer is $C=\frac{4}{3}$'"'
