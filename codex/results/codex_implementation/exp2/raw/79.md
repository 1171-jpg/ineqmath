## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality:

\[
a^4 + 2b^4 + 3c^4 + d^4 + 3abcd \quad () \quad \frac{1}{2} \sum_{cyc} a^3(b+c+d).
\]

### Step 1: Simplify the right-hand side

The right-hand side can be expanded as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{cyc} a^3(b+c+d) = \frac{1}{2} \left( a^3(b+c+d) + b^3(c+d+a) + c^3(d+a+b) + d^3(a+b+c) \right).
\]

Let's break this down further. For any non-negative \( a, b, c, d \):

- Each term \( a^3(b+c+d) \) is non-negative since \( a, b, c, d \geq 0 \).
- Hence, the entire expression sums to zero or greater.

### Step 2: Compare the expressions

Now, we need to verify if:

\[
a^4 + 2b^4 + 3c^4 + d^4 + 3abcd \quad () \quad \frac{1}{2} \sum_{cyc} a^3(b+c+d).
\]

### Step 3: Test specific examples

1. **Consider \( a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0 \)**:
   - LHS = \( 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \),
   - RHS = \( 0 \).

   Conclusion: \( 0 = 0 \).

2. **Consider \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 1 \)**:
   - LHS = \( 1^4 + 2 \cdot 1^4 + 3 \cdot 1^4 + 1^4 + 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 10 \),
   - RHS = \( \frac{1}{2} (1^3(1 + 1 + 1) + 1^3(1 + 1 + 1) + 1^3(1 + 1 + 1) + 1^3(1 + 1 + 1)) = \frac{1}{2} (3 + 3 + 3 + 3) = 6 \).

   So here, \( 10 \geq 6 \).

3. **Consider \( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0 \)**:
   - LHS = \( 1^4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 \),
   - RHS = \( \frac{1}{2} (1^3 \cdot 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 0 \).

   Again, \( 1 \geq 0 \).

### Step 4: General Inequality Testing

Using the **AM-GM Inequality** for \( x_1 = a^4, x_2 = b^4, x_3 = b^4, x_4 = c^4, \ldots \):

Given that \( abcd \) is a convex combination, it provides more room for the left side to be greater than the right.

### Conclusion

Based on the test cases and comparisons:

- The inequality holds that the left-hand side is always greater than or equal to the right-hand side for non-negative values of \( a, b, c, d \).

Thus, the correct relation to fill in the blank is:

'The answer is (B) $\geq$'
