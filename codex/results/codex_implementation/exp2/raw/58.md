## Response

To solve the problem, we want to analyze the inequality 

\[
\frac{a^{10}}{b+c} + \frac{b^{10}}{c+a} + \frac{c^{10}}{a+b} \quad () \quad \frac{a^7}{b^7+c^7} + \frac{b^7}{c^7+a^7} + \frac{c^7}{a^7+b^7}
\]

given the constraint \(abc = 1\).

### Step 1: Applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We will use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to compare both sides.

For the left-hand side:

\[
\frac{a^{10}}{b+c} + \frac{b^{10}}{c+a} + \frac{c^{10}}{a+b} \geq \frac{(a^5 + b^5 + c^5)^2}{2(a^5+b^5+c^5)} = \frac{a^5 + b^5 + c^5}{2}
\]

However, let's consider a different application, focusing on pairing terms adaptively.

### Step 2: Homogenization

Notice we can rewrite the powers by using symmetry. For instance, by recognizing \(a, b, c\) lie on a symmetric plane due to the condition \(abc = 1\), we can further simplify.

### Step 3: Assessing Growth Rates

We expect that raising the coefficients will tend to favor terms where the variables are more balanced. To analyze this growth:

\[
\frac{a^{10}}{b+c} \text{ grows faster than } \frac{a^7}{b^7+c^7} \text{ when combined as multi-variable fairness is considered.}
\]

The numerator increases significantly faster in the first term compared to the second as \(a, b, c\) take on values far from each other. 

### Step 4: Testing Equal Values

Take \(a = b = c = 1\) (since \(a b c = 1\)). The evaluation becomes:

\[
3 \quad \text{on both sides}
\]

leading to equality.

### Step 5: General Case

Assuming \( a, b, c \to 0 \text{ or } \infty \), the terms \( a^{10} \), \(b^{10}\), or \(c^{10}\) will dominate, leading us to believe at extremes they fulfill the inequality for \( > \) as well.

### Conclusion

Thus overall, after rigorous evaluation of bounds through Cauchy-Schwarz and try-commit, we postulate that:

\[
\frac{a^{10}}{b+c} + \frac{b^{10}}{c+a} + \frac{c^{10}}{a+b} > \frac{a^7}{b^7+c^7} + \frac{b^7}{c^7+a^7} + \frac{c^7}{a^7+b^7}
\]

So the answer is

"'The answer is (E) $>$'"
