## Response

To solve the inequality problem, we start with the given condition and inequality:

1. **Given Inequality**: 
   \[
   a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 10
   \]

2. **Target Inequality**: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \quad () \quad 1
   \]

### Step 1: Analyze the given condition

We know 
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq a + b
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 2(a + b) \implies 2(a + b) \leq 10 \implies a + b \leq 5
\]

### Step 2: Understanding \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b}\)

Let's express \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \) in terms of positive constants. 

### Step 3: Boundaries for \( a \) and \( b \)

From \( a + b \leq 5 \), both \( a \) and \( b \) must be positive. Let's deduce boundaries:

Taking the simplest cases:
- If \( a = b \), we have \( 2a \leq 5 \implies a \leq 2.5 \)
- Evaluate at limits, choose \( a = x \) and \( b = 5 - x \).

### Step 4: Analyze \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{5 - a}\)

Set \( b = 5 - a \) and our expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{5 - a}
\]

### Step 5: Apply AM-GM Inequality

By applying the AM-GM Inequality:
\[
\frac{a + (5 - a)}{2} \geq \sqrt{a(5 - a)}
\]
However, it is not straightforward.

### Step 6: Testing Values

Let’s test specific values under the constraint \( a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 10 \):

1. **Assume \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 4 \)**
   \[
   1 + 4 + \sqrt{1^2 + 4^2} = 1 + 4 + \sqrt{17} \approx 1 + 4 + 4.12 = 9.12 \leq 10
   \]
   Compute:
   \[
   \frac{1}{1} + \frac{2}{4} = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 > 1
   \]

2. **Assume \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 3 \)**
   \[
   2 + 3 + \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = 2 + 3 + \sqrt{13} \approx 2 + 3 + 3.61 = 8.61 \leq 10
   \]
   Compute:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} = 0.5 + 0.6667 \approx 1.1667 > 1
   \]

### Final Step: General Evaluation

For combinations where \( a + b \) gets closer to \( 5 \):
The function \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b}\) varies positively as \( a \to 0 \) and \( b \to 0 \), but the constraint \( a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) does limit this significantly. Consequently, we can argue the ratio:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq 1
\]

### Conclusion

Hence, the correct relation for the inequality will be:

```
'The answer is (B) ≥'
```
