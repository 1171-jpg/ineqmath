Solution:

## Response

To solve this inequality problem, we aim to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the following holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \):

\[
\frac{a}{\sqrt{3a + 2b + c}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{3b + 2c + a}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{3c + 2a + b}} \leq C \sqrt{a + b + c}
\]

### Step 1: Establish the inequality

We can analyze the left-hand side and simplify it under specific conditions. One effective approach is to consider the case when \( a = b = c \).

Let \( a = b = c = k \) for some positive real number \( k \). The inequality then becomes:

\[
\frac{k}{\sqrt{3k + 2k + k}} + \frac{k}{\sqrt{3k + 2k + k}} + \frac{k}{\sqrt{3k + 2k + k}} \leq C \sqrt{3k}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify

Calculating the left side:

\[
\frac{k}{\sqrt{6k}} + \frac{k}{\sqrt{6k}} + \frac{k}{\sqrt{6k}} = 3 \cdot \frac{k}{\sqrt{6k}} = \frac{3 \sqrt{k}}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{3} = \sqrt{3k}
\]

Thus, our inequality simplifies to:

\[
\sqrt{3k} \leq C \sqrt{3k}
\]

Dividing both sides by \( \sqrt{3k} \) (which is valid since \( k > 0 \)) gives:

\[
1 \leq C
\]

### Step 3: Test for equality

Now we need to find if \( C = 1 \) is indeed the smallest constant. If \( C = 1 \), we want to verify:

\[
\frac{a}{\sqrt{3a + 2b + c}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{3b + 2c + a}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{3c + 2a + b}} \leq \sqrt{a + b + c}
\]

### Step 4: Verify the case \( C = 1 \)

Using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
\left(\sum_{cyc} \frac{a}{\sqrt{3a + 2b + c}}\right)\left(\sum_{cyc} a(3a + 2b + c)\right) \geq (a + b + c)^2
\]

Calculating the second sum:

\[
\sum_{cyc} a(3a + 2b + c) = 3(a^2+b^2+c^2) + 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]

We then need to show:

\[
\frac{(a + b + c)^2}{3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2(ab + bc + ca)} \leq 1
\]

This inequality is known to be true by Cauchy-Schwarz, showcasing that indeed \( C = 1 \) can be achieved.

### Conclusion

Thus, we conclude that the smallest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \) is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
