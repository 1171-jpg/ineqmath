## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition:

\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(ab + bc + ca). \]

This can be rearranged to:

\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 0, \]

which simplifies to:

\[ (a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2 = 0. \]

This implies that:

\[ a = b = c. \]

Let's denote \( a = b = c = k \) for some non-zero real number \( k \).

Next, we substitute this back into the expression we need to analyze:

\[
(a+b+c)\left(\frac{1}{2a}+\frac{1}{3b}+\frac{1}{c}\right).
\]

With \( a = b = c = k \), we have:

\[
a + b + c = k + k + k = 3k.
\]

Now, computing the expression for \( a, b, c = k \):

\[
\frac{1}{2a} + \frac{1}{3b} + \frac{1}{c} = \frac{1}{2k} + \frac{1}{3k} + \frac{1}{k}.
\]

Combining these fractions, we find a common denominator, which would be \( 6k \):

\[
\frac{3}{6k} + \frac{2}{6k} + \frac{6}{6k} = \frac{3 + 2 + 6}{6k} = \frac{11}{6k}.
\]

Thus, the entire expression becomes:

\[
(3k) \left(\frac{11}{6k}\right) = \frac{33k}{6k} = \frac{33}{6} = 5.5.
\]

Now, we need to compare this value to 14:

\[
5.5 \quad() \quad 14.
\]

Clearly, since \( 5.5 < 14 \), we can conclude that:

The correct inequality is \( < \).

Thus, the final answer format is:

```plaintext
'The answer is (D) <'
