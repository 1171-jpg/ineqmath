## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2} \quad () \quad n^2 + n.
\]

### Step 1: Analyzing the Left Side

1. Rewrite the terms to separate contributions:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{1+x_i^2}.
   \]

2. **Bound for \(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2}\)**:

   Since \(x_i > 0\) and \(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1\), we know \(x_i\) is bounded in the range \(0 < x_i < 1\).

   For small \(x_i\):
   - \( \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} \approx x_i \) leading to \( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} < \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1 \).

   For large \(x_i\):
   - \( \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} \to 0 \) as \(x_i \to 1\).

   Overall, \( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} < 1\).

3. **Bound for \(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{1+x_i^2}\)**:

   Since \(0 < x_i < 1\), we can observe the following:
   - Each \( \frac{n}{1+x_i^2} \quad \text{is bounded above by} \quad n\).

   Thus,
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{1+x_i^2} \leq n^2.
   \]

### Step 2: Combine Results

From both bounds:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2} < 1 + n^2.
\]

### Step 3: Assess Total vs. Desired Quantity

Now comparing with \(n^2 + n\):
1. We have:
   \[
   1 + n^2 < n^2 + n
   \]
   for \(n > 1\).

Summarily, for any \(n > 1\):
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2} < n^2 + n.
\]

### Answer

Based on our analysis:
- The correct relationship to fill the blank is:
  
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2} \quad < \quad n^2 + n.
  \]

Thus, the answer is:

'"'The answer is (D) $<$'"'
