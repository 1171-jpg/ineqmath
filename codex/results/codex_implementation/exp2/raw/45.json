    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality \n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^3}{x-4} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all \\( x > 4 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Function\nThe left-hand side of the inequality is a function of \\( x \\):\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{x^3}{x - 4}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the Limit as \\( x \\) Approaches 4\nAs \\( x \\) approaches 4 from the right, we can calculate the limit:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 4^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 4^+} \\frac{x^3}{x - 4}.\n\\]\nThis limit evaluates to:\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 4^+} f(x) = \\frac{64}{0^+} = +\\infty.\n\\]\nThus, \\( f(x) \\) tends to infinity as \\( x \\) approaches 4, ensuring that the inequality can hold for all \\( C \\) less than infinity.\n\n### Step 3: Behavior at Large Values of \\( x \\)\nNext, we check the behavior of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches infinity:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{x^3}{x - 4} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{x^2}{1 - \\frac{4}{x}} = \\infty.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Local Minimum\nTo find the largest constant \\( C \\), we need to determine the local minimum of \\( f(x) \\) over \\( x > 4 \\). We find the critical points by setting the derivative \\( f'(x) \\) to zero.\n\nUsing the quotient rule:\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{(3x^2)(x - 4) - (x^3)(1)}{(x - 4)^2}.\n\\]\nSetting the numerator equal to zero:\n\\[\n3x^2(x - 4) - x^3 = 0 \\implies 3x^3 - 12x^2 - x^3 = 0 \\implies 2x^3 - 12x^2 = 0.\n\\]\nFactoring out:\n\\[\n2x^2(x - 6) = 0.\n\\]\nThis gives the critical points \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 6 \\). We need to check \\( x = 6 \\) since \\( x > 4 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate \\( f(6) \\)\nCalculating \\( f(6) \\):\n\\[\nf(6) = \\frac{6^3}{6 - 4} = \\frac{216}{2} = 108.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Conclude the Solution\nSince \\( f(x) \\) approaches infinity both as \\( x \\to 4^+ \\) and as \\( x \\to \\infty \\), and has a local minimum at \\( x = 6 \\) of \\( 108 \\), we determine that the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all \\( x > 4 \\) is \n\\[\nC = 108.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n'''The answer is $C=108$'''\n",
