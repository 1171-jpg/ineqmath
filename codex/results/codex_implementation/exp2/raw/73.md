## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality given the condition \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3 \). 

### Step 1: Understand the Inequality

We need to determine whether the following inequality holds:

\[
\frac{b+c}{a^2} + \frac{c+a}{b^2} + \frac{a+b}{c^2} \quad () \quad 3\left(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} - abc\right).
\]

### Step 2: Simplifying the Left Side

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{b+c}{a^2} + \frac{c+a}{b^2} + \frac{a+b}{c^2}\right) \left(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\right) \geq (b+c + c+a + a+b)^2 = (2a + 2b + 2c)^2 = 4(a+b+c)^2.
\]

Since we know \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3 \), we can write:

\[
\frac{b+c}{a^2} + \frac{c+a}{b^2} + \frac{a+b}{c^2} \geq \frac{4(a+b+c)^2}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the Right Side

Now, transforming the right-hand side \( 3\left(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} - abc\right) \):

1. The expression \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \) can be approached using the AM-HM inequality:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}}{3} \geq \frac{3}{a+b+c}.
\]

We know \( abc \) is a product of three positive numbers that adhere to \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3 \). 

### Step 4: Testing an Example

Let's assume \( a = b = c = 1 \):

Then both sides become:

- Left Side:
  \[
  \frac{1 + 1}{1^2} + \frac{1 + 1}{1^2} + \frac{1 + 1}{1^2} = 6.
  \]
  
- Right Side:
  \[
  3\left(3 - 1\right) = 3 \cdot 2 = 6.
  \]

Thus for \( a = b = c = 1 \), we find that both sides are equal:

\[
\frac{b+c}{a^2} + \frac{c+a}{b^2} + \frac{a+b}{c^2} = 3\left(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} - a b c\right).
\]

### Step 5: Final Conclusion

Since the inequality holds as equality for \( a = b = c = 1 \) but testing other combinations generally yields \(\geq\), we conclude that the most fitting option is:
