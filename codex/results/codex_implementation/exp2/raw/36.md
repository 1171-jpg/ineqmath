Problem: Given the real number $b \leq 2$, find the largest constant $C$ such that for all positive real numbers $x, y$ where $xy = 1$, the following inequality holds:

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given inequality:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{C} + \frac{b}{x+y} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

with the constraints \(xy = 1\) and \(b \leq 2\). Let's first express \(y\) in terms of \(x\). Since \(xy = 1\), we have \(y = \frac{1}{x}\).

### Step 1: Rewrite the Inequality

Substituting \(y\) into the inequality gives:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2}}{C} + \frac{b}{x + \frac{1}{x}} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Terms

The term \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) simplifies as follows:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{x^4 + 1}{x^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{x^4 + 1}}{x}
\]

Now, simplifying \(x + y\):

\[
x + \frac{1}{x}
\]

### Step 3: Substitute Back into the Inequality

The inequality now reads:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^4 + 1}}{Cx} + \frac{b}{x + \frac{1}{x}} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

Since \(x + \frac{1}{x} \geq 2\) (by AM-GM inequality), we can observe the bounds for \(b\).

### Step 4: Analyze Behavior as \(x \to 1\)

Setting \(x = 1\):

\[
\sqrt{1^4 + 1} = \sqrt{2}, \quad \text{and} \quad 1 + \frac{b}{2} = 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{C} + \frac{b}{2} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{C} \geq 1
\]
\[
C \leq \sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 5: Consider Extremes of \(b\)

For \(b = 2\):

\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}}}{C} + \frac{2}{x + \frac{1}{x}} \geq 1 + 1
\]
\[
\Rightarrow \frac{\sqrt{x^4 + 1}}{Cx} + \frac{2}{x + \frac{1}{x}} \geq 2
\]

Setting \(x = 1\):

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{C} + 1 \geq 2
\]
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{C} \geq 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad C \leq \sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 6: Final Result

The calculations show that the largest value of \(C\) satisfying the inequality for all \(b \leq 2\) is:

\[
C = \sqrt{2}
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

```
The answer is $C=\sqrt{2}$
