$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{x^3}{x-4} \geq C
\]

holds for all \( x > 4 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Function
The left-hand side of the inequality is a function of \( x \):
\[
f(x) = \frac{x^3}{x - 4}.
\]

### Step 2: Find the Limit as \( x \) Approaches 4
As \( x \) approaches 4 from the right, we can calculate the limit:

\[
\lim_{x \to 4^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 4^+} \frac{x^3}{x - 4}.
\]
This limit evaluates to:
\[
\lim_{x \to 4^+} f(x) = \frac{64}{0^+} = +\infty.
\]
Thus, \( f(x) \) tends to infinity as \( x \) approaches 4, ensuring that the inequality can hold for all \( C \) less than infinity.

### Step 3: Behavior at Large Values of \( x \)
Next, we check the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches infinity:

\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^3}{x - 4} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{1 - \frac{4}{x}} = \infty.
\]

### Step 4: Find the Local Minimum
To find the largest constant \( C \), we need to determine the local minimum of \( f(x) \) over \( x > 4 \). We find the critical points by setting the derivative \( f'(x) \) to zero.

Using the quotient rule:
\[
f'(x) = \frac{(3x^2)(x - 4) - (x^3)(1)}{(x - 4)^2}.
\]
Setting the numerator equal to zero:
\[
3x^2(x - 4) - x^3 = 0 \implies 3x^3 - 12x^2 - x^3 = 0 \implies 2x^3 - 12x^2 = 0.
\]
Factoring out:
\[
2x^2(x - 6) = 0.
\]
This gives the critical points \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 6 \). We need to check \( x = 6 \) since \( x > 4 \).

### Step 5: Evaluate \( f(6) \)
Calculating \( f(6) \):
\[
f(6) = \frac{6^3}{6 - 4} = \frac{216}{2} = 108.
\]

### Step 6: Conclude the Solution
Since \( f(x) \) approaches infinity both as \( x \to 4^+ \) and as \( x \to \infty \), and has a local minimum at \( x = 6 \) of \( 108 \), we determine that the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( x > 4 \) is 
\[
C = 108.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
'''The answer is $C=108$'''
