Problem: Let $x > 4$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x$:

$$
\frac{x^3}{x-4} \geq C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To determine the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\frac{x^3}{x-4} \geq C
\]

holds for all \( x > 4 \), we will analyze the expression \( \frac{x^3}{x-4} \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Function

We first express the function in terms of \( x \):

\[
f(x) = \frac{x^3}{x-4}
\]

### Step 2: Find the Limit as \( x \to 4^+ \)

As \( x \to 4^+ \):

\[
f(x) = \frac{4^3}{4-4} \to \infty
\]

This suggests that \( f(x) \) approaches infinity as \( x \) approaches 4 from the right. Thus the function \( f(x) \) does not have any lower bound approaching \( x = 4 \).

### Step 3: Analyze Behavior as \( x \) Increases

Now we will evaluate the function at large values of \( x \):

As \( x \) becomes large:

\[
f(x) \to \frac{x^3}{x} = x^2
\]

This implies that as \( x \to \infty \), \( f(x) \) will also approach infinity, indicating there is no global minimum for large values of \( x \).

### Step 4: Finding a Lower Bound for \( C \)

Now we need to determine if there exists a constant \( C \) such that \( f(x) \geq C \). We can find the minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x > 4 \) by considering the derivative:

#### Step 4.1: Differentiate \( f(x) \)

Using the quotient rule to differentiate \( f(x) \):

\[
f'(x) = \frac{(x-4)(3x^2) - x^3(1)}{(x-4)^2}
\]
\[
= \frac{3x^2(x-4) - x^3}{(x-4)^2}
\]
\[
= \frac{3x^3 - 12x^2 - x^3}{(x-4)^2}
\]
\[
= \frac{2x^3 - 12x^2}{(x-4)^2}
\]
\[
= \frac{2x^2(x - 6)}{(x-4)^2}
\]

#### Step 4.2: Set the Derivative to Zero

To find critical points, set \( f'(x) = 0 \):

\[
2x^2(x - 6) = 0
\]

This gives us \( x = 0 \), \( x = 6 \) (we discard \( x = 0 \) since we are only interested in \( x > 4 \)).

#### Step 4.3: Evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = 6 \)

Now calculate \( f(6) \):

\[
f(6) = \frac{6^3}{6-4} = \frac{216}{2} = 108
\]

### Step 5: Confirm \( C = 108 \)

Since we've confirmed that at \( x = 6 \), the function's minimum value is \( 108 \) for \( x > 4 \), we conclude that:

\[
C = 108
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the answer is:

```
'The answer is $C=108$'
