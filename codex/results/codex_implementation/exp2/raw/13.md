Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to maximize the constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) \geq C
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) satisfying \( x + y = 1 \).

### Step 1: Rewrite the Inequality

Starting with the given inequality:

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) = \left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{1-x}\right)
\]

This can be expanded to:

\[
1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} + \frac{1}{x(1-x)}
\]

### Step 2: Combine Terms

So we have:

\[
1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} + \frac{1}{x(1-x)}
\]

We need to find how small this expression can be, as this will determine our \( C \).

### Step 3: Calculate the Expression

The terms \( \frac{1}{x} \) and \( \frac{1}{1-x} \) can be combined as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} = \frac{1 - x + x}{x(1-x)} = \frac{1}{x(1-x)}
\]

So we have:

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x}\right) + \frac{1}{x(1-x)} = 1 + \frac{2}{x(1-x)}
\]

### Step 4: Set Up the Variable

Let’s set \( x = a \), then \( y = 1 - a \), and rewrite the expression in terms of \( a \):

\[
1 + \frac{2}{a(1-a)}
\]

The function \( a(1-a) \) reaches its maximum at \( a = 0.5 \). Thus we evaluate:

\[
a(1-a) = 0.5(1-0.5) = 0.25 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{2}{a(1-a)} = \frac{2}{0.25} = 8
\]

### Step 5: Final Expression

Now substituting this into our expression:

\[
1 + 8 = 9
\]

Thus, the inequality holds:

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) \geq 9
\]

### Conclusion

The largest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all positive \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x + y = 1 \) is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

```
The answer is $C=9$
