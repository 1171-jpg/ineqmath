## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality given:

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) \geq C
\]

with the constraint that \(x + y = 1\) for positive real numbers \(x\) and \(y\).

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Rewrite the Inequality:**
   Start by expanding the left-hand side of the inequality:

   \[
   \left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{xy}
   \]

   Now substituting \(y = 1 - x\):

   \[
   1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1 - x} + \frac{1}{x(1 - x)}
   \]

2. **Simplify the Expression:**
   The expression becomes:

   \[
   1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1 - x} + \frac{1}{x(1 - x)} = 1 + \frac{(1-x) + x}{x(1 - x)} + \frac{1}{x(1 - x)}
   \]

   Simplifying further yields:

   \[
   1 + \frac{1}{x(1 - x)}
   \]

3. **Finding the Minimum Value:**
   We need to minimize the expression \(1 + \frac{1}{x(1-x)}\). The term \(\frac{1}{x(1-x)}\) can be simplified by transform into a single variable.

4. **Using AM-GM Inequality:**
   The product \(xy\) is maximized when \(x = y\). Given \(x + y = 1\), we can set \(x = y = \frac{1}{2}\):

   \[
   xy = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

   Therefore:

   \[
   1 + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}} = 1 + 4 = 5
   \]

5. **Evaluating \(C\):**
   The value of \(1 + \frac{1}{xy}\) yields its minimum as \(5\). Thus, at the point where \(x = y = \frac{1}{2}\):

   \[
   \left(1+\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}}\right) = (1 + 2)(1 + 2) = 3 \times 3 = 9 \geq C
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, the largest constant \(C\) that satisfies this inequality is:

   \[
   C = 5
   \]
