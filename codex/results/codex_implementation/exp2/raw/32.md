Problem: Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(x+1)(y+2) = 8$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the constraint:

\[
(x + 1)(y + 2) = 8.
\]

From this equation, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):

\[
y + 2 = \frac{8}{x + 1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac{8}{x + 1} - 2.
\]

Next, we substitute \(y\) into the expression we need to analyze:

\[
|xy - 10| \geq C.
\]

Substituting \(y\):

\[
xy = x\left(\frac{8}{x + 1} - 2\right) = \frac{8x}{x + 1} - 2x.
\]

Thus, 

\[
|xy - 10| = \left| \frac{8x}{x + 1} - 2x - 10\right| = \left| \frac{8x - 2x(x + 1) - 10(x + 1)}{x + 1} \right|.
\]

Simplifying inside the absolute value:

\[
= \left| \frac{8x - 2x^2 - 2x - 10}{x + 1} \right| = \left| \frac{-2x^2 + 6x - 10}{x + 1} \right|.
\]

Next, we can further simplify:

\[
= \left| \frac{-2(x^2 - 3x + 5)}{x + 1} \right| = 2\frac{|x^2 - 3x + 5|}{|x + 1|}.
\]

To find \(C\), we need to find the minimum value of \( |xy - 10| \) under the constraint given by \( (x + 1)(y + 2) = 8 \).

Let's first examine the quadratic expression:

\[
f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 5.
\]

To find the extremum of \(f(x)\), we compute its derivative and find the critical points:

\[
f'(x) = 2x - 3.
\]

Setting the derivative to zero gives:

\[
2x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{3}{2}.
\]

Now we evaluate \(f\) at this point:

\[
f\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 3\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) + 5 = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{9}{2} + 5 = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{18}{4} + \frac{20}{4} = \frac{11}{4}.
\]

Next, we determine the minimum value of \( |xy - 10| \):

\[
|xy - 10| = 2\frac{|f(x)|}{|x + 1|} = 2\frac{|x^2 - 3x + 5|}{|x + 1|}.
\]

We must ensure that \( (x + 1) \) never equals zero, which is valid since \(x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{-1\}\).

Next, we find the min of \( |x^2 - 3x + 5| \).

The discriminant of the quadratic \(x^2 - 3x + 5\) is:

\[
D = (-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 5 = 9 - 20 = -11.
\]

This indicates that \(x^2 - 3x + 5\) does not cross the x-axis and is always positive. The minimum value occurs at the vertex, \( \frac{11}{4} \).

Now plug this value back in:

\[
C = 2 \cdot \frac{11/4}{|x + 1|},
\]

As \(x\) varies, since \( |x + 1| \geq 1 \) when \(x > -2\), we have a bound of:

\[
C = 2 \cdot \frac{11/4}{1} = \frac{11}{2}.
\]

Thus, the maximum \(C\) that satisfies the given inequality is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{11}{2}}.
\]

Therefore, the final answer format is:

```
'The answer is $C=\frac{11}{2}$'
