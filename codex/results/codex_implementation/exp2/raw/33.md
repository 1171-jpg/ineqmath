Problem: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $abc = 1$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$:

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \) such that \( abc = 1 \).

### Step 1: Substitute Variables
Since \( abc = 1 \), we can express \( a, b, c \) in terms of a single variable. We can set:

\[
a = \frac{x}{y}, \quad b = \frac{y}{z}, \quad c = \frac{z}{x}
\]

where \( x = a, y = b, z = c \) are positive real numbers. This keeps \( abc = 1 \).

### Step 2: Rewrite the Expression
Now, let's analyze the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} = \frac{y}{x} + \frac{z}{y} + \frac{x}{z}
\]

### Step 3: Apply the AM-GM Inequality
To find a lower bound for this expression, we can apply the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, which states:

\[
\frac{x + y + z}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz}
\]

In our case, we have:

\[
\frac{y}{x} + \frac{z}{y} + \frac{x}{z} \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{y}{x} \cdot \frac{z}{y} \cdot \frac{x}{z}} = 3 \sqrt[3]{1} = 3
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion
This shows that:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq 3
\]

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) that satisfies this inequality for all positive reals \( a, b, c \) such that \( abc = 1 \) is 

\[
C = 3.
\]

### Final Answer
Therefore, the answer is 

"'The answer is $C=3$'".
