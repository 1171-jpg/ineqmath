## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

\[
\left(\frac{2x}{y}+3\right)\left(\frac{3y}{z}+1\right)\left(\frac{z}{x}+1\right) \quad () \quad 2+\frac{2(x+y+z)}{\sqrt[3]{x y z}}.
\]

1. **Simplify each term on the left side**:
   - The first term \(\frac{2x}{y} + 3\) can be simplified depending on the values of \(x\) and \(y\).
   - Similarly, \(\frac{3y}{z} + 1\) and \(\frac{z}{x} + 1\) can also vary with \(y\) and \(z\).

2. **Examine the right side**:
   - The term \(2 + \frac{2(x+y+z)}{\sqrt[3]{xyz}}\) combines a constant (2) with a term that involves the arithmetic mean \(x+y+z\) compared to the geometric mean \(\sqrt[3]{xyz}\).

3. **Use the AM-GM Inequality**: 
   - By applying the AM-GM inequality on \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), we have:
     \[
     \frac{x+y+z}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz} \Rightarrow x+y+z \geq 3\sqrt[3]{xyz}.
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     \frac{2(x+y+z)}{\sqrt[3]{xyz}} \geq 6.
     \]
   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
     \[
     2 + \frac{2(x+y+z)}{\sqrt[3]{xyz}} \geq 8.
     \]

4. **Estimate the left side**:
   - Applying the lower bound estimates for \(x, y, z\), set \(x = y = z\) (for simplicity in analysis). This leads to:
     \[
     \left(\frac{2x}{x}+3\right)\left(\frac{3x}{x}+1\right)\left(\frac{x}{x}+1\right) = (2 + 3)(3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 \times 4 \times 2 = 40.
     \]
   - This suggests that for equal values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) the product can become significantly larger than \(8\).

5. **Conjecture the inequality**:
   - Given that the left-hand side can assume values well exceeding \(8\), while the right side is bounded above, a reasonable conjecture is:
   \[
   \left(\frac{2x}{y} + 3\right)\left(\frac{3y}{z} + 1\right)\left(\frac{z}{x} + 1\right) \geq 2 + \frac{2(x+y+z)}{\sqrt[3]{xyz}}.
   \]
   
6. **Final conclusion**: By testing values and simplifying assumptions, we determine the left-hand side can grow without bound compared to the right-hand side, thus the relation must be 

\[
\boxed{(B) \geq}.
\]

Hence, the answer following the requested format is:

`'The answer is (B) ≥'`
