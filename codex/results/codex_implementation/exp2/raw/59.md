## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression given, \( |x - y + z| \), under the constraint \( x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = \frac{2}{5} a^2 \).

### Step 1: Establish the Constraint

The constraint defines a three-dimensional ellipsoid in the \( (x,y,z) \) space:

\[
x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = \frac{2}{5} a^2
\]

### Step 2: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any real numbers \( a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3 \):

\[
(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + b_3^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3)^2.
\]

### Step 3: Configure for Our Variables

Let:

- \( a_1 = x, a_2 = \sqrt{2}y, a_3 = z \) (note that \( \sqrt{2}y \) accounts for the coefficient in the constraint),
- \( b_1 = 1, b_2 = -1, b_3 = 1 \).

Applying Cauchy-Schwarz, we have:

\[
(x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2)(1^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2) \geq (x - y + z)^2.
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the Inequality

The left-hand side becomes:

\[
(x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2)(3) \geq (x - y + z)^2.
\]

Substituting our constraint:

\[
3 \left(\frac{2}{5} a^2\right) \geq (x - y + z)^2.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{6}{5} a^2 \geq (x - y + z)^2.
\]

Taking the square root on both sides gives us:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} a \geq |x - y + z|.
\]

### Step 5: Relate Back to \( a \)

The inequality we have is:

\[
|x - y + z| \leq \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} a.
\]

### Step 6: Comparison with \( a \)

Since \( \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} > 1 \), it indicates that:

\[
|x - y + z| \text{ is bounded above by a multiple of } a.
\]

However, that does not provide a strict inequality. Thus, we can conclude:

### Step 7: Determine the Relation

Thus, the answer to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (A) ≤
