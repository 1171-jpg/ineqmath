## Response

To solve the given inequality, we can employ methods from the realm of inequalities, particularly focusing on Jensen's inequality since we are dealing with positive reals.

### Steps of the Solution:

1. **Understand the variables**:
   Given that \(a + b + c = 1\) and \(a, b, c > 0\), we can consider each of these as fractions of a whole. Therefore, it’s reasonable to explore the inequality using the properties of convex functions.

2. **Define the function**:
   We are looking at the expression:
   \[
   S = a \sqrt[3]{1+b-c} + b \sqrt[3]{1+c-a} + c \sqrt[3]{1+a-b}.
   \]

3. **Apply Jensen's Inequality**:
   The cube root function \(\sqrt[3]{x}\) is a concave function for \(x \geq 0\). Thus, according to Jensen's inequality, we have:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{\frac{1+b-c + 1+c-a + 1+a-b}{3}} \leq \frac{1}{3} \left( S \right).
   \]
   The average \(1 + b - c + 1 + c - a + 1 + a - b = 3\) simplifies to \(1\), hence:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \leq S.
   \]
   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   S \geq 1.
   \]

4. **Resulting inequality**:
   The inequality derived from applying Jensen's inequality tells us that:
   \[
   a \sqrt[3]{1+b-c} + b \sqrt[3]{1+c-a} + c \sqrt[3]{1+a-b} \geq 1.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The inequality clearly indicates that the left-hand side is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, we conclude that the correct relation to fill in the blank is:

'"'"'The answer is (B) $\geq$'"'"'
