Problem: Let $a, b, c \neq 0$ such that $a^2+b^2+c^2=2(ab+bc+ca)$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given condition:

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given condition:

1. **Given Condition Interpretation**: 
   We have \( a, b, c \neq 0 \) and the equation:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(ab + bc + ca).
   \]
   This can be rearranged to:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 0,
   \]
   or equivalently:
   \[
   (a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2 = 0.
   \]
   This implies that \( a = b = c \).

2. **Equality Case**:
   Let \( a = b = c = k \) where \( k \) is any non-zero number. Then we substitute \( a, b, \) and \( c \) into the inequality we want to analyze:
   \[
   (k + k + k) \left( \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} \right) \geq C.
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   3k \left( \frac{3}{k} \right) = 9.
   \]
   So for this equality case, the left side always equals \( 9 \).

3. **Finding the Bound**:
   We propose that \( C \) might be at maximum \( 9 \). To verify, we need to check if the inequality holds true generally and not just under the equality case.
   Plugging \( C = 9 \) into the inequality yields:
   \[
   (a + b + c)\left(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}\right) \geq 9.
   \]

4. **Using AM-HM inequality**:
   For three positive numbers, \( a, b, c \), we know:
   \[
   \frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \frac{3}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}}.
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   (a+b+c)\left(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}\right) \geq 9.
   \]

Therefore, we have verified that the largest constant \( C \) satisfying this inequality is indeed \( 9 \).

### Conclusion
Thus, our final answer, as per the specified format is:
```
'The answer is $C=9$'
```
