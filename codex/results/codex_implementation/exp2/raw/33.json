    "response": "To solve the problem, we'll determine the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the following inequality holds for all positive real numbers \\( a, b, c \\) where \\( abc = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} \\geq C.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Applying the AM-GM Inequality\n\nAccording to the arithmetic mean-geometric mean (AM-GM) inequality, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{x_1 x_2 x_3},\n\\]\n\nfor non-negative \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\). \n\nLet's apply this to our expression by substituting \\( x_1 = \\frac{1}{a}, x_2 = \\frac{1}{b}, x_3 = \\frac{1}{c} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{abc}}.\n\\]\n\nSince we know \\( abc = 1 \\), we can simplify this:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{abc}} = \\sqrt[3]{1} = 1.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Expressing the Inequality\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} \\geq 3.\n\\]\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nis satisfied for \\( C = 3 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Verifying if \\( C = 3 \\) is the Largest Constant\n\nTo check if \\( C = 3 \\) is indeed the largest possible value, we can test with \\( a = b = c = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1} = 3.\n\\]\n\nSince this holds as an equality when \\( a = b = c = 1 \\) and the AM-GM inequality shows that the sum can never be less than 3 for any positive \\( a, b, c \\) such that \\( abc = 1 \\), we confirm that \\( C = 3 \\) is the largest constant.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the largest constant \\( C \\) satisfying the inequality for all positive real numbers \\( a, b, c \\) (where \\( abc = 1 \\)) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is } C=3.\n\\]\n",
