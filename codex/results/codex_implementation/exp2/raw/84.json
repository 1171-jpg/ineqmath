    "response": "To solve the given inequality, we can employ methods from the realm of inequalities, particularly focusing on Jensen's inequality since we are dealing with positive reals.\n\n### Steps of the Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the variables**:\n   Given that \\(a + b + c = 1\\) and \\(a, b, c > 0\\), we can consider each of these as fractions of a whole. Therefore, it\u2019s reasonable to explore the inequality using the properties of convex functions.\n\n2. **Define the function**:\n   We are looking at the expression:\n   \\[\n   S = a \\sqrt[3]{1+b-c} + b \\sqrt[3]{1+c-a} + c \\sqrt[3]{1+a-b}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply Jensen's Inequality**:\n   The cube root function \\(\\sqrt[3]{x}\\) is a concave function for \\(x \\geq 0\\). Thus, according to Jensen's inequality, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1+b-c + 1+c-a + 1+a-b}{3}} \\leq \\frac{1}{3} \\left( S \\right).\n   \\]\n   The average \\(1 + b - c + 1 + c - a + 1 + a - b = 3\\) simplifies to \\(1\\), hence:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \\leq S.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   S \\geq 1.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Resulting inequality**:\n   The inequality derived from applying Jensen's inequality tells us that:\n   \\[\n   a \\sqrt[3]{1+b-c} + b \\sqrt[3]{1+c-a} + c \\sqrt[3]{1+a-b} \\geq 1.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe inequality clearly indicates that the left-hand side is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, we conclude that the correct relation to fill in the blank is:\n\n'\"'\"'The answer is (B) $\\geq$'\"'\"'\n",
