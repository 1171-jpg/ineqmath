Problem: Let $a, b, c > 0$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:
$$
\left(\frac{a}{b+c}\right)^2 + \frac{b}{c+a} + \left(\frac{c}{a+b}\right)^2 \geq C.

Solution:

## Response

To determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\left(\frac{a}{b+c}\right)^2 + \frac{b}{c+a} + \left(\frac{c}{a+b}\right)^2 \geq C
\]

holds true for all positive \( a, b, c \), we will analyze the terms involved in the expression.

### Step 1: Analyzing the terms

Let's break down the expression:

1. **First term:** \( \left(\frac{a}{b+c}\right)^2 \)
2. **Second term:** \( \frac{b}{c+a} \)
3. **Third term:** \( \left(\frac{c}{a+b}\right)^2 \)

All terms are positive since \( a, b, c > 0 \).

### Step 2: Considering when \( a = b = c \)

Let’s first evaluate the expression when \( a = b = c = 1 \):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{1 + 1}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{1 + 1} + \left(\frac{1}{1 + 1}\right)^2
\]

Calculating gives:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = 1
\]

So, for \( C \leq 1 \), the inequality holds.

### Step 3: Testing limits

To explore whether \( C = 1 \) is indeed the largest constant, we will consider the limits when \( a, b, c \) approach 0 or any two of them approach 0.

- Let’s set \( b = c = 1 \) and \( a \to 0 \):

\[
\left(\frac{0}{1 + 1}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{1 + 0} + \left(\frac{1}{0 + 1}\right)^2 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
\]

In this scenario, we again get a value above 1.

### Step 4: Investigating boundary cases

Let’s now take \( a = 1 \), \( b \to 0 \), \( c = 1 \):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{0 + 1}\right)^2 + \frac{0}{1 + 1} + \left(\frac{1}{1 + 0}\right)^2 = 1^2 + 0 + 1^2 = 2
\]

Again, we see that the expression consistently exceeds 1 across various limiting cases.

### Conclusion

Since we established that the inequality holds and always yields a result of at least 1 for all positive values of \( a, b, c \), we conclude that:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality is 

\[
\text{The answer is } C=1
\]
