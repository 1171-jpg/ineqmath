## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} \quad () \quad 2 \sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c},
\]

we will analyze both sides.

### Step 1: Analyze the Left Side

The left-hand side is 

\[
S_L = \sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}}.
\]

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
\left(\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}}\right)^2 \leq \left(\sum_{cyc} (b+c)\right) \left(\sum_{cyc} \frac{1}{(a+b)(a+c)}\right).
\]

Now, note that:

\[
S_L = \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} + \frac{c+a}{\sqrt{(b+c)(b+a)}} + \frac{a+b}{\sqrt{(c+a)(c+b)}}.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Right Side

The right-hand side is 

\[
S_R = 2 \sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c},
\]

which can be simplified to:

\[
S_R = \sum_{cyc} \frac{4a}{2b+c}.
\]

### Step 3: Try Specific Assignments

Let’s consider \(a = b = c\). If we let \(a = b = c = 1\), then we can find both sides:

- For the left side:

\[
S_L = 3 \cdot \frac{1 + 1}{\sqrt{(1 + 1)(1 + 1)}} = 3 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{4}} = 3 \cdot 1 = 3.
\]

- For the right side:

\[
S_R = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \frac{2}{2 + 1} = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 4.
\]

### Step 4: Compare the Results

From our calculations:

\[
S_L = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad S_R = 4.
\]

Thus, 

\[
S_L < S_R.
\]

### Conclusion

As we see from our analysis, the left side is less than the right side for \(a = b = c\). To ensure this holds true in general, we can employ additional methods or inequalities, but the calculated values strongly suggest that:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} < 2 \sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c}.
\]

Thus, we conclude that the correct inequality relation is:

'"'The answer is (A) $\leq$'"'
