## Response

To solve the problem, we will analyze the given inequality:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{a}{a+2} \quad ? \quad 1
\]

where \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3 \) and \( a, b, c \geq 0 \).

### Step 1: Use Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
We know from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality that:

\[
\left( \sum_{cyc} \frac{a}{a+2} \right) \left( \sum_{cyc} (a+2) \right) \geq (a+b+c)^2
\]

The sum in the second factor simplifies as follows:

\[
\sum_{cyc} (a + 2) = (a + b + c) + 6
\]

### Step 2: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz
So we can rewrite our inequality from Cauchy-Schwarz:

\[
\left( \sum_{cyc} \frac{a}{a+2} \right) \left( a + b + c + 6 \right) \geq (a+b+c)^2
\]

Let \( s = a + b + c \). We can substitute into the inequality:

\[
\left( \sum_{cyc} \frac{a}{a+2} \right) (s + 6) \geq s^2
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the Values of \( s \)
Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3 \), we can express \( s \):

\[
s^2 \leq 3(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 9 \implies s \leq 3
\]

### Step 4: Consider Extremes
If we set \( a = b = c = 1 \), then we have:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{1}{1+2} = 3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1
\]

Next, let's investigate the case when one variable is much larger than the others. Suppose \( a = \sqrt{3}, b = c = 0 \):

\[
\frac{a}{a+2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} + 2} < 1
\]

This shows that in the extreme case, the sum can indeed be less than 1.

### Conclusion by Consideration of Boundary Cases
At \( a = b = c = 1 \), we have equality. If \( a, b, c \) deviate from this balance (i.e., if one is larger than the others, reducing the corresponding fractions), the overall sum will decrease.

### Final Consideration
Thus we conclude that:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{a}{a+2} \leq 1
\]

This supports that the inequality relation to fill in the blank is:
