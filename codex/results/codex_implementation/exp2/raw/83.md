## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the equation given:

\[
c^2 + d^2 = (a^2 + b^2)^3.
\]

We want to evaluate the relationship between the expression 

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d}
\]

and the number 1.

Let's invoke the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any non-negative real numbers \( x_i \) and \( y_i \):

\[
(x_1^2 + x_2^2)(y_1^2 + y_2^2) \geq (x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2)^2.
\]

Let:

- \( x_1 = \frac{a^3}{c} \)
- \( x_2 = \frac{b^3}{d} \)
- \( y_1 = c \)
- \( y_2 = d \)

Then we have:

\[
\left(\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d}\right)(c + d) \geq (a^3 + b^3)^2.
\]

Next, applying Cauchy-Schwarz to \( c^2 + d^2 \), we find:

\[
(c + d)^2 \leq 2(c^2 + d^2).
\]

Substituting \( c^2 + d^2 = (a^2 + b^2)^3 \) into this inequality gives:

\[
(c + d)^2 \leq 2(a^2 + b^2)^3.
\]

Now, we square both sides to connect it to the original expression we are analyzing:

Thus:

\[
(c + d)^2 = c^2 + d^2 + 2cd.
\]

From our Cauchy analysis:

\[
\frac{a^3 + b^3}{c + d} \geq \frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d}.
\]

This leads to the conclusion that:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \leq \frac{(a^3 + b^3)(c + d)}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/2}}.
\]

We also note that, since \( c^2 + d^2 \) grows as \( (a^2 + b^2)^3 \) becomes larger, we can establish that:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} < (a^3 + b^3).
\]

However, we need to relate it back to the number 1.

Now, if we assume \( c = d = (a^2 + b^2)^{3/2} \):

\[
\frac{a^3}{(a^2+b^2)^{3/4}} + \frac{b^3}{(a^2+b^2)^{3/4}},
\]
\[
= \frac{a^3 + b^3}{(a^2 + b^2)^{3/4}}.
\]

By the AM-GM inequality, we also know:

\[
a^3 + b^3 \geq 2\sqrt{a^3b^3} = 2ab\sqrt{ab},
\]

which, if normalized, may yield \( < 1 \) depending on \( a \) and \( b \).

Thus, through our reasoning with inequalities, we converge on:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \leq 1.
\]

### Conclusion:
Based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and AM-GM implications,

We can conclude:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \leq 1.
\]

Thus, the answer is:

'TThe answer is (A) $\leq$'
