Problem: Given four real numbers $a, b, c, d \geq 0$ satisfying $a \geq b + 7c + d$, find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$:

$$
7(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a) \geq C a b c d
$$

Solution:

## Response

To find the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
7(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a) \geq C a b c d
\]

holds for all non-negative \( a, b, c, d \) satisfying \( a \geq b + 7c + d \), we can utilize the AM-GM inequality which states that the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. 

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Assess the inequality using AM-GM**:
   We start by analyzing the left-hand side:
   
   \[
   (a+b), (b+c), (c+d), (d+a)
   \]

   By AM-GM, we have the following inequalities:
   \[
   a + b \geq 2\sqrt{ab}, \quad b + c \geq 2\sqrt{bc}, \quad c + d \geq 2\sqrt{cd}, \quad d + a \geq 2\sqrt{da}
   \]

   Therefore, we can rewrite the product of the sums:
   \[
   7(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a) \geq 7(2\sqrt{ab})(2\sqrt{bc})(2\sqrt{cd})(2\sqrt{da}) = 7 \cdot 16 \sqrt{(abcd)^2} = 112 abcd
   \]

   Hence, we get:
   \[
   7(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a) \geq 112 abcd
   \]

2. **Find \( C \)**:
   From the inequality derived:
   \[
   112 abcd \geq C abcd
   \]
   implies 
   \[
   C \leq 112.
   \]

3. **Testing the equality case**:
   Now we check if \( C = 112 \) can be achieved under the given constraints. Consider the case when \( a = b = c = d = 1 \):
   \[
   7(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 7 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 112
   \]
   And \( abcd = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \) holds.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Checking other combinations under \( a \geq b + 7c + d \) demonstrates that the inequality still holds, confirming that the maximum \( C \) is achievable.

Thus, the solution to the problem states:

```
The answer is $C=112$
