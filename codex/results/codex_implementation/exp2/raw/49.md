Problem: Let $p > q > 0$. Determine the largest constants $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$:

\frac{p+q}{p-q} \geq C\frac{2(x^2-2 q x+p^2)}{x^2+2 q x+p^2}

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\frac{p+q}{p-q} \geq C\frac{2(x^2-2 q x+p^2)}{x^2+2 q x+p^2}
\]

for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), we'll follow these steps:

1. **Rearranging the Inequality**:
   Rewrite the inequality as:

   \[
   C \leq \frac{(p+q)(x^2 + 2qx + p^2)}{(p-q) \cdot 2(x^2 - 2qx + p^2)}
   \]

2. **Finding Critical Points**:
   We need to analyze the expression on the right-hand side:

   \[
   \frac{(p+q)(x^2 + 2qx + p^2)}{(p-q)(2(x^2 - 2qx + p^2))}
   \]

   This involves simplifying and finding its maximum value for all \( x \).

3. **Analyzing the Rational Function**:
   Let:

   \[
   f(x) = \frac{(p+q)(x^2 + 2qx + p^2)}{2(x^2 - 2qx + p^2)}
   \]

   The critical points occur where the derivative \( f'(x) = 0 \). To find this, compute \( f'(x) \) using the quotient rule:

   \[
   f'(x) = \frac{(p+q)(2x + 2q)(2(x^2 - 2qx + p^2)) - (p+q)(x^2 + 2qx + p^2) \cdot 4(x - q)}{(2(x^2 - 2qx + p^2))^2}
   \]

   Set the numerator to zero and solve for \( x \).

4. **Identifying Value Limits**:
    Investigate limits as \( x \to \pm\infty \):

   \[
   \lim_{x \to \pm \infty} f(x) = \frac{(p+q)}{2}
   \]

   The maximum of \( f(x) \) will also occur at critical points found in step 3.

5. **Taking Supremum**:
   Let \( C \) equal the maximum value of \( \frac{(p+q)}{(p-q)} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \):

   \[
   C = \frac{(p+q)}{2(p-q)}
   \]

   This value holds as the largest \( C \) such that the inequality is satisfied for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).

Putting everything together, we conclude that:

\[
C = \frac{p+q}{2(p-q)}
\]

Finally, in the requested format: 

```plaintext
The answer is $C=\frac{p+q}{2(p-q)}$
