Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the inequality given:

\[
\frac{a^3 + 2b^3 + 2c^3}{abc} \geq C
\]

where \( a, b, c \) are positive real numbers such that \( a \geq b + c \).

### Step 1: Examining the left side of the inequality
First, we can rewrite the expression:

\[
\frac{a^3 + 2b^3 + 2c^3}{abc} = \frac{a^3}{abc} + \frac{2b^3}{abc} + \frac{2c^3}{abc} = \frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{2b^2}{ac} + \frac{2c^2}{ab}
\]

### Step 2: Apply the conditions 
Given \( a \geq b + c \), we will derive some bounds. Let's analyze \( a = b + c \) as it allows us to minimize \( a \) while maintaining the condition.

Substituting \( a = b + c \):

\[
\frac{(b+c)^2}{bc} + \frac{2b^2}{(b+c)c} + \frac{2c^2}{(b+c)b}
\]

### Step 3: Simplifying the expression
Now we use:

\[
\frac{(b+c)^2}{bc} = \frac{b^2 + 2bc + c^2}{bc} = \frac{b}{c} + 2 + \frac{c}{b}
\]

And for \( \frac{2b^2}{(b+c)c} \):

\[
\frac{2b^2}{(b+c)c} = \frac{2b}{c + b}
\]

Similarly for \( \frac{2c^2}{(b+c)b} \):

\[
\frac{2c^2}{(b+c)b} = \frac{2c}{b + c}
\]

### Step 4: Using AM-GM Inequality
Since \( a \geq b + c \), we will employ the AM-GM inequality, which states that: 

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{x_1 x_2 x_3}
\]

for any non-negative numbers \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \). 

Applying AM-GM helps find a lower bound:

\[
\frac{(b+c)^2}{bc} + \frac{2b^2}{(b+c)c} + \frac{2c^2}{(b+c)b} \geq 5
\]

By setting \( C = 5 \), we check if it holds under these conditions.

### Step 5: Verifying if \( C = 5 \) holds
Testing the values leads us to check edge cases, specifically \( b = c \). Thus, let’s evaluate the inequality for \( b = c \):

Let’s set \( b = c = 1 \):

\[
a \geq 2
\]
Then,

\[
\frac{(2)^3 + 2(1)^3 + 2(1)^3}{2(1)(1)} = \frac{8 + 2 + 2}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

This meets the \( C = 5 \) condition. Thus, the maximum constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality is indeed:

\[
C = 5
\]

### Final Result
Hence, we conclude:

'''The answer is $C=5$'''
