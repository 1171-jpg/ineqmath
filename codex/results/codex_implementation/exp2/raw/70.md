## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality:

\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} \quad () \quad -3a + b + 7c.
\]

We can begin by examining each left-hand side term separately and then comparing it with \( -3a + b + 7c \).

### Step 1: Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we can write:

\[
\left( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} \right) \left( b + c + \frac{4a}{3} \right) \geq (a + b + 4c)^2
\]

This implies that:

\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} \geq \frac{(a + b + 4c)^2}{b + c + \frac{4a}{3}}.
\]

### Step 2: Estimating Lower Bound

Next, we analyze the expression \( -3a + b + 7c \). To compare \( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} \) with \( -3a + b + 7c \), we can intuitively test cases.

### Step 3: Test Case for Values

Let's consider setting \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1^2}{1} + \frac{1^2}{1} + \frac{4 \cdot 1^2}{1} = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.
\]

Calculating the right-hand side gives:

\[
-3 \cdot 1 + 1 + 7 \cdot 1 = -3 + 1 + 7 = 5.
\]

Thus, 

\[
6 \quad () \quad 5.
\]

This suggests that the left-hand side is greater than the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} \geq -3a + b + 7c
\]

### Step 4: Generalization

We can see that tried and tested values suggest a pattern, so we start hypothesizing that the left-hand side must generally be greater than the right-hand side.

To ensure the validity of our inference, we can try another set, such as:
- If \( a = 1, b = 2, c = 1 \) leads to similar conclusions.

Based on positive and increasing nature of each term on the left-hand side, it appears that:

\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} \geq -3a + b + 7c
\]

Thereby confirming our suggestion that:

\[
\text{The correct inequality is } \geq.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, our filled-in inequality is:

\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} \geq -3a + b + 7c.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

'''The answer is (B) $\geq$'''
