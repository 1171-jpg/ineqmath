Solution:

## Response

To find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{a^3}{a^3 + abc + b^3} + \frac{b^3}{b^3 + abc + c^3} + \frac{c^3}{c^3 + abc + a^3} \geq C
\]

holds for all \( a, b, c > 0 \), we can analyze the expression using various techniques including symmetric properties and known inequalities.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Symmetry Considerations**:
   The expression is homogeneous and symmetric in \( a, b, c \). Thus, we can assume \( a + b + c = 1 \) without loss of generality.

2. **Change of Variables**:
   Set \( a = x, b = y, c = z \) such that \( x + y + z = 1 \). Thus, we need to show:

   \[
   \frac{x^3}{x^3 + xyz + y^3} + \frac{y^3}{y^3 + xyz + z^3} + \frac{z^3}{z^3 + xyz + x^3} \geq C.
   \]

3. **Use of Known Inequalities**:
   By using Titu's lemma (or Cauchy-Schwarz inequality), we have:

   \[
   \frac{x^3}{x^3 + xyz + y^3} + \frac{y^3}{y^3 + xyz + z^3} + \frac{z^3}{z^3 + xyz + x^3} \geq \frac{(x+y+z)^3}{\sum (x^3 + y^3 + xyz)}.
   \]

   Since \( x + y + z = 1 \), this simplifies to 

   \[
   \frac{1}{\sum (x^3 + y^3 + xyz)}.
   \]

4. **Bounding the Denominator**:
   We consider the special case where \( x = y = z \). Without loss of generality, set \( a = b = c \). This leads to:

   \[
   \frac{a^3}{a^3 + a^3 + a^3} = \frac{a^3}{3a^3} = \frac{1}{3}.
   \]

   Thus:

   \[
   3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1.
   \]

5. **Finding the Bound**:
   Therefore, we check if:

   \[
   C \leq 1.
   \]

6. **Testing Lower Values of \( C \)**:
   We must assess whether lower values work. For \( C = \frac{1}{2} \):

   \[
   1 \geq \frac{1}{2} \text{ is true.}
   \]

   For values approaching \( C = 1 \), we find the sums maintain the equality.

### Conclusion:
After the examination, we conclude that the maximum constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) is:

\[
C = 1.
\]
