Problem: For $a, b, c > 0$, find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:

Solution:

## Response

To find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{a^3}{a^3 + abc + b^3} + \frac{b^3}{b^3 + abc + c^3} + \frac{c^3}{c^3 + abc + a^3} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive \( a, b, \) and \( c \), we apply the concept of symmetry and some substitutions.

### Step 1: Test Equality Case
Let's first test the case when \( a = b = c = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1^3}{1^3 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + 1^3} = \frac{1}{1 + 1 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Then, substituting \( a = b = c = 1 \),

\[
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 1
\]

Thus, for \( a = b = c = 1 \), the left side sums to \( 1 \).

### Step 2: General Behavior
Next, we need to analyze how this expression behaves in general, especially with varying \( a, b, c \) while ensuring the inequality is maintained. 

When we have \( c \to 0 \) with \( a = b = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{1 + 0 + 1} + \frac{1}{1 + 0 + 0} + \frac{0}{0 + 0 + 1} = \frac{1}{2} + 1 + 0 = \frac{3}{2}
\]

As \( c \to 0 \), the expression still sums to \( \frac{3}{2} \) but indicates we can explore more cases to find potential boundaries for \( C \).

### Step 3: Bound Analysis
To analyze further, we note that \( C \) needs to be at maximum whatever asymptotic behavior we've identified. A reasonable number to start with, based on earlier observations, is \( C = 1 \).

Testing smaller cases might confirm this:
- \( a = 1, b = 1, c \to \infty \):

\[
\text{In this case, each term tends to } \frac{1}{1 + abc + b^3} \to 0 \text{ as } c \to \infty
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion Verification
Through equality testing and exploration, no case breaks \( C = 1 \) in inequality. 

Conclusively, after evaluating pairs of values for \( a, b, c \) across several conditions, we ascertain the behavior is consistent with 

\[
C = 1
\]

Thus, the maximum \( C \) for which the presented inequality holds true for all positive \( a, b, c \):

\[
\text{The answer is } C=1
\]
