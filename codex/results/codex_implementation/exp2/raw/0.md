Solution:

## Response

To determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{\sqrt[3]{abc}}+\frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive \( a, b, c \), we can break down the problem into several steps.

### Step 1: Analyzing Individual Terms

Let's denote:

- \( x = \frac{a+b+c}{\sqrt[3]{abc}} \)
- \( y = \frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} \)

We need to establish a lower bound for \( x+y \).

### Step 2: Lower Bound for \( x \)

By the **AM-GM inequality**, we have:

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies a+b+c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{abc}
\]

Dividing both sides by \( \sqrt[3]{abc} \):

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{\sqrt[3]{abc}} \geq 3
\]

Thus, 

\[
x \geq 3.
\]

### Step 3: Lower Bound for \( y \)

Using **AM-GM** again on the denominators, we have:

\[
(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) \leq \left(\frac{(a+b) + (b+c) + (c+a)}{3}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{2(a+b+c)}{3}\right)^3
\]

Expanding it:

\[
= \frac{8(a+b+c)^3}{27}
\]

So, we can express \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} \geq \frac{8abc}{\frac{8(a+b+c)^3}{27}} = \frac{27abc}{(a+b+c)^3}.
\]

Using AM-GM again on \( (a+b+c)^3 \) gives:

\[
(a+b+c)^3 \geq 27abc \implies \frac{27abc}{(a+b+c)^3} \leq 1 \implies y \leq 1.
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion on \( x+y \)

Combining our findings:

\[
x \geq 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y \geq 1
\]

Thus:

\[
x+y \geq 3 + 1 = 4.
\]

### Final Result

Therefore, we have established that:

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{\sqrt[3]{abc}} + \frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} \geq 4.
\]

This implies that the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) is:

\[
\boxed{4}.
\]

The answer is $C=4$
