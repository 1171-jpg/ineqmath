## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality \(a^5 + 16b^5 \) given that \(a + b = 1\) where \( a, b \geq 0 \).

1. **Substitution**: Since \(b = 1 - a\), we can rewrite the inequality as:
   \[
   a^5 + 16(1 - a)^5.
   \]

2. **Expansion**: We expand \( (1 - a)^5 \) using the binomial theorem:
   \[
   (1 - a)^5 = 1 - 5a + 10a^2 - 10a^3 + 5a^4 - a^5.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   16(1 - a)^5 = 16\left(1 - 5a + 10a^2 - 10a^3 + 5a^4 - a^5\right) = 16 - 80a + 160a^2 - 160a^3 + 80a^4 - 16a^5.
   \]
   Hence, the expression becomes:
   \[
   a^5 + 16b^5 = a^5 + 16 - 80a + 160a^2 - 160a^3 + 80a^4 - 16a^5 = -15a^5 + 80a^4 + 160a^2 - 80a + 16.
   \]

3. **Analyzing the range**:
   We simplify \(a^5 + 16b^5\) over the interval \(a \in [0, 1]\):
   - When \(a = 0\), \(b = 1\),
     \[
     0^5 + 16 \times 1^5 = 16.
     \]
   - When \(a = 1\), \(b = 0\),
     \[
     1^5 + 16 \times 0^5 = 1.
     \]
   - When \(a = \frac{1}{2}\), \(b = \frac{1}{2}\),
     \[
     \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 + 16\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 = \frac{1}{32} + 16 \times \frac{1}{32} = \frac{1 + 16}{32} = \frac{17}{32} \approx 0.53125.
     \]

4. **Identify maximum and minima**:
   Examining the boundaries shows:
   - At \(a = 0\), \(a^5 + 16b^5 = 16\).
   - At \(a = 1\), \(a^5 + 16b^5 = 1\).

   The minimum occurs at \(a=1\) and maximum when \(a = 0\).

5. **Comparing values**:
   Therefore, \(a^5 + 16b^5\) varies from \(1\) at \(a=1\) to \(16\) at \(a=0\).

   Since the maximum value is \(16\) and we want to verify if it satisfies:
   \[
   a^5 + 16b^5 \leq \frac{1}{6}.
   \]
   \(a^5 + 16b^5\) can attain values much greater than \(\frac{1}{6}\).

6. **Conclusion**:
   Given that \(a^5 + 16b^5\) can reach up to \(16\) (and is generally greater than \(\frac{1}{6}\)), we conclude:
   \[
   a^5 + 16b^5 \geq \frac{1}{6}.
   \]
   Hence, the correct option is:

"'The answer is (B) $\geq$'"
