Problem: Let $x, y$ be positive real numbers such that $x + y = 2$. Determine the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y$:

$$
x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3) \leq C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the inequality 

\[ x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3) \leq C \]

subject to the constraint \( x + y = 2 \) with \( x, y \) as positive real numbers.

### Step 1: Simplifying \( x^3 + y^3 \)

Using the identity for the sum of cubes, we have:

\[
x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) = 2(x^2 - xy + y^2)
\]

### Step 2: Expressing \( x^2 - xy + y^2 \)

From the condition \( x + y = 2 \), we can derive:

\[
x^2 - xy + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 3xy = 4 - 3xy
\]

### Step 3: Substituting into the inequality

Substituting this back, we get:

\[
x^3 + y^3 = 2(4 - 3xy) = 8 - 6xy
\]

Thus the inequality becomes:

\[
x^3 y^3 (8 - 6xy) \leq C
\]

### Step 4: Letting \( a = xy \)

Using the identity \( x + y = 2 \) and AM-GM inequality, we know:

\[
xy \leq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = 1
\]

Define \( a = xy \). The expression simplifies to:

\[
x^3 y^3 = (xy)^3 = a^3
\]

So the inequality now reads:

\[
a^3 (8 - 6a) \leq C
\]

### Step 5: Finding the maximum of \( a^3(8 - 6a) \)

We want to maximize:

\[
f(a) = a^3(8 - 6a)
\]

Calculating the derivative:

\[
f'(a) = 3a^2(8 - 6a) - 6a^3 = a^2(24 - 30a)
\]

Setting the derivative to zero:

\[
a^2(24 - 30a) = 0
\]

This gives us \( a = 0 \) or \( 24 - 30a = 0 \), leading to \( a = \frac{24}{30} = \frac{4}{5} \).

### Step 6: Evaluating the maximum value at \( a = 1 \)

Since \( a \) can't exceed \( 1 \), evaluate \( f \) at the two critical points \( a = 0 \) and \( a = 1 \):

1. **At \( a = 0 \)**:
   \[
   f(0) = 0^3(8 - 6 \cdot 0) = 0
   \]

2. **At \( a = 1 \)**:
   \[
   f(1) = 1^3(8 - 6 \cdot 1) = 1(8 - 6) = 2
   \]

### Conclusion

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(a) = a^3(8 - 6a) \) is \( 2 \) when \( a = 1 \). Therefore, the smallest constant \( C \) satisfying the inequality for all positive \( x, y \) such that \( x + y = 2 \) is:

\[
C = 2
\]

Putting it in the required format yields:
