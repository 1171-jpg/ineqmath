Problem: Let $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$:

$$

$$

Solution:

## Response

To determine the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c+d}
\]

holds for all \( a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}^+ \), we will explore this inequality through direct application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

### Step 1: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \right) (a + b + c + d) \geq (1 + 1 + 2 + 4)^2 = 8^2 = 64
\]

### Step 2: Reformulate the Inequality

From the Cauchy-Schwarz application, we can reformulate the inequality we derived:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{64}{a+b+c+d}
\]

This means we can take \( C = 64 \) and demonstrate that it satisfies the original condition.

### Step 3: Verify if \( C = 64 \) is the Largest Constant

Now we need to check if it is possible for \( C \) to be larger than \( 64 \). Suppose \( C > 64 \), then:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c+d} \Rightarrow \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \right)(a + b + c + d) \geq C
\]

which would contradict our previous deduction from Cauchy-Schwarz when \( C > 64 \).

### Final Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) satisfying the inequality is indeed \( C = 64 \).

Therefore, we conclude:

```
'The answer is $C=64$'
