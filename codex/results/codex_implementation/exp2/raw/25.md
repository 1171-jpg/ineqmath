Solution:

## Response

To determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the following inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c, d \):

\[
\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{4}{c}+\frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c+d},
\]

we will utilize the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

### Step 1: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form:

\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 \right) \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \right)^2,
\]

we can apply it as follows. Let:

- \( x_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}, x_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{b}}, x_3 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{c}}, x_4 = \frac{4}{\sqrt{d}} \)
- \( y_1 = \sqrt{a}, y_2 = \sqrt{b}, y_3 = \sqrt{c}, y_4 = \sqrt{d} \)

Then,

\[
\left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \right) \left( a + b + c + d \right) \geq (1 + 1 + 2 + 4)^2 = 64.
\]

### Step 2: Simplifying the Inequality

This gives us:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{64}{a + b + c + d}.
\]

This indicates that for the inequality

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{C}{a + b + c + d},
\]

to hold for all positive \( a, b, c, d \), we have \( C \) must not exceed 64.

### Step 3: Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{4}{c}+\frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c+d}
\]

holds true for all positive \( a, b, c, d \) is:

\[
\boxed{64}.
\]

### Final Answer

\[
\text{The answer is } C=64.
