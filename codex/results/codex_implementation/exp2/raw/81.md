## Response

To tackle the problem, we'll analyze the given conditions and the expression step by step.

### Given Conditions
1. **Sum Condition**: \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = 0 \)
2. **Difference Condition**: \( \max \{|a_i - a_j| \mid 1 \leq i, j \leq n\} \leq 1 \)

From the difference condition, it follows that all \( a_i \)'s must lie within the range \([M, M+1]\) for some real number \( M \).

### Step 1: Use Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the terms \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \):

\[
(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2)(1 + 1 + \ldots + 1) \geq (a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2) n \geq 0
\]

### Step 2: Bound the Expression

Next, we want to analyze \( a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 \):

Since \( a_i \)'s are constrained by their maximum difference being at most 1, we can derive bounds for \( a_i \) based on their average, which is zero (since they sum up to zero):

- Assume \( a_i = x_i - C \) where \( C = \frac{1}{n}(a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n) = 0 \).
  
Thus, \( |a_i| \leq \frac{1}{2} \) to keep the maximum difference constraint intact.

### Step 3: Calculate the Maximum Total Squared Value

To bound \( a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 \):

- The maximum occurs when some \( a_i \) are at \( \frac{1}{2} \) and others at \( -\frac{1}{2} \).
  
### Step 4: Total Squares Calculation

If there are \( k \) values of \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( n-k \) values of \( -\frac{1}{2} \), then:

\[
a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 = k\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + (n - k)\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) = \frac{n}{4}
\]

### Step 5: Compare to the Right Side

Now, calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{n}\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right]
\]

This evaluates as follows (for ease, assume \( n \) is even, say \( n = 2m \)):

\[
\frac{1}{n}\left[m\right]\left[m + \frac{1}{2}\right] = \frac{m^2 + \frac{m}{2}}{2m} = \frac{m}{2} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Final Inequality Assessment

We need to establish whether:

\[
\frac{n}{4} \quad \text{is } \quad \frac{n}{4} \left( (A) \leq, (B) \geq, (C) =, (D) <, (E) >, (F) \text{None of the above} \right)
\]

From our analysis and calculating \( a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 \), it aligns precisely:

\[
a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 = \frac{n}{4}
\]

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
\frac{n}{4} = \frac{1}{n} \left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right]
\]

### Conclusion

The correct inequality relation is:

``'The answer is (C) ='``
