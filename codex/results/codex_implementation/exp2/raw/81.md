## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the conditions given and determine the correct inequality relating the sum of squares of \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) to the given expression.

1. **Understanding the Expressions**: 

   We have:
   \[
   S = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2
   \]

   We're interested in comparing \( S \) with:
   \[
   \frac{1}{n}\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right]
   \]

2. **Applying the Given Conditions**:

   - **Condition 1**: \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = 0 \) implies that the numbers balance around zero.
   - **Condition 2**: \( \max \{|a_i - a_j| \mid 1 \leq i, j \leq n\} \leq 1 \) indicates that the values \( a_i \) are constrained within a range of 1 unit.

3. **Bounding the Sum of Squares**:

   Since \( |a_i - a_j| \leq 1 \) for all \( i, j \), we have:
   - If we assume \( a_i \) achieves a maximum value \( M \) and a minimum value \( m \), then:
   \[
   M - m \leq 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad M \leq m + 1
   \]
   And because \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = 0 \), we can also derive that the average is in bounds that affect the sum of squares.

4. **Using the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**:

   From the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
   \[
   (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2)(1 + 1 + \ldots + 1) \geq (a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n)^2 
   \]
   We simplify this to: 
   \[
   S \cdot n \geq 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad S \geq 0
   \]

5. **Calculating the Bound**:

   Given that \( |a_i| \leq |a_j| + 1 \) and with the zero-sum condition, a useful consideration is the case where all \( a_i = 0 \), and slight deviations around this point will keep \( |a_i| \) within bounds of 0 and 1. 

   The total variance of such bounded numbers leads us to compare:
   \[
   S \leq \frac{n}{4} \quad (\text{derived from the variance of the distribution})
   \]

6. **Finding the Expression on the Right**:

   Now, let's simplify:
   \[
   \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{n}{2} \cdot \frac{n+1}{2} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{4n} = \frac{n + 1}{4}
   \]

7. **Conclusion**:

   After analyzing, we conclude:
   - The maximum sum of squares \( S \) cannot exceed the values described by the expression on the right due to the constraints provided in the problem.

Thus, we find:
\[
a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 \leq \frac{1}{n}\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right]
\]

So, the correct inequality is:

'"'The answer is (A) $\leq$'"'
