Problem: Let $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4$. Find the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To find the minimal constant \( C \) such that 

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq C
\]

for all \( a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R} \) satisfying the constraint 

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4,
\]

we can utilize the method of Lagrange multipliers or another approach involving inequalities. Here’s a clear and logical breakdown of the solution steps:

### Step 1: Analyze the Variables

Since \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \) constrains \( a, b, c, d \) to a sphere of radius 2 in \( \mathbb{R}^4 \), we will consider maximizing \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \) under this constraint.

### Step 2: Utilize the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)(a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4) \geq (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3)^2.
\]

Plugging in the constraint:

\[
4(a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4) \geq (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3)^2.
\]

### Step 3: Maximize \( a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 \)

To find the upper bounds effectively, we can apply the Power Mean inequality, among others.

The Power Mean inequality states that if \( p > q \), then:

\[
\left( \frac{x_1^p + x_2^p + x_3^p + x_4^p}{4} \right)^{\frac{1}{p}} \geq \left( \frac{x_1^q + x_2^q + x_3^q + x_4^q}{4} \right)^{\frac{1}{q}}.
\]

Specifically, we consider \( p=4 \) and \( q=3 \):

\[
\left( \frac{a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4}{4} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}} \geq \left( \frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3}{4} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}.
\]

### Step 4: Determine Maximum Values

From \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \), we can estimate that for the maximum nature of cubes compared to squares, we should assess the extremal case when one variable has the majority share of the total capacity under the limit.

Let’s consider \( a = 2 \) and \( b = c = d = 0 \):

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 = 2^3 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8.
\]

### Step 5: Validate Against Other Variables

Alternately, if we distribute the values evenly across four variables, i.e.,

\[
a = b = c = d = 1,
\]

the calculation yields:

\[
1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3 = 4.
\]

This shows a potential maximum of 8 is confirmative as

\[
C = 8.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the minimal constant \( C \) is determined to be

\[
\text{The answer is } C = 8.
\] 

So, the formal answer format yields:

```plaintext
'The answer is $C=8$'
