Problem: Let $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4$. Find the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$ satisfying the given constraint:

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimal constant \( C \) such that 

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq C
\]

for all \( a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R} \) satisfying the condition \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \).

**Step 1: Understanding the constraint**

The condition \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \) describes a 3-dimensional sphere with radius 2 in \(\mathbb{R}^4\) (as there are four variables). 

**Step 2: Apply the Power Mean Inequality**

We can apply the Power Mean Inequality which states that for non-negative real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) and for \( p \leq q \):

\[
\left( \frac{x_1^q + x_2^q + \ldots + x_n^q}{n} \right)^{\frac{1}{q}} \geq \left( \frac{x_1^p + x_2^p + \ldots + x_n^p}{n} \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
\]

In our case, let \( p = 2 \) and \( q = 3 \), where we have \( n = 4 \):

\[
\left( \frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3}{4} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \leq \left( \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2}{4} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]

Given our constraint \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \):

\[
\left( \frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3}{4} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \leq \left( \frac{4}{4} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 1
\]

Thus, raising both sides to the third power:

\[
\frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3}{4} \leq 1
\]
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq 4
\]

**Step 3: Finding the constant \( C \)**

From our derivation, we get \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq 4 \). Therefore, the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c, d \) constrained by \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \) is:

\[
C = 4
\]

**Conclusion**

Thus, the answer to the problem is:

```
'The answer is $C=4$'
