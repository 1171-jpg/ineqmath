Solution:

## Response

To determine the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
x(x-y)(z-x) \leq C
\]

holds for all \( x, y, z \in [0, 1] \), we will analyze the expression \( f(x, y, z) = x(x-y)(z-x) \).

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

The term \( f(x, y, z) \) can be rewritten as follows:

\[
f(x, y, z) = x(z-x)(x-y).
\]

This expression is a product of three factors:
1. \( x \in [0, 1] \)
2. \( z-x \), which also varies depending on the values of \( z \) and \( x \)
3. \( x-y \), which depends on values of \( y \) and \( x \).

### Step 2: Consider boundaries for \( x, y, z \)

To find the maximum value of \( f(x, y, z) \), we need to consider the boundaries of the variables:

1. If \( x = 0 \), then \( f(0, y, z) = 0 \).
2. If \( y = 0 \), then \( f(x, 0, z) = xz - x^2 \).
3. If \( x = 1 \), regardless of \( y \) and \( z \), the value of \( f(1, y, z) = 0 \).
4. If \( z = 0 \), then it follows similar reasoning as when \( x = 0 \).

### Step 3: Choose values for \( x, y, z \)

To find the maximum value, we will test specific combinations of \( x, y, z \).

- **Case 1**: Set \( x = 1, y = 0, z = 1 \):

\[
f(1, 0, 1) = 1(1-0)(1-1) = 0.
\]

- **Case 2**: Set \( x = \frac{1}{2}, y = 0, z = 1 \):

\[
f\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0, 1\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2} - 0\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}.
\]

- **Case 3**: Set \( x = \frac{1}{2}, y = \frac{1}{4}, z = 1 \):

\[
f\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, 1\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

- **Case 4**: Set \( x = 1, y = 1, z = 0 \):

\(
f(1, 1, 0) = 1(0 - 1)(1 - 1) = 0.
\)

### Step 4: Store maximum obtained values

After testing various combinations, we notice that the maximum value of \( f(x, y, z) \) was achieved at \( f\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0, 1\right) = \frac{1}{8} \).

### Conclusion: Find minimal \( C \)

Thus, the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
x(x-y)(z-x) \leq C
\]

holds for all \( x, y, z \in [0, 1] \) is:

\[
C = \frac{1}{8}.
\]

### Final Answer

'''The answer is $C=\frac{1}{8}$'''
