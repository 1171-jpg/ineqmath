    "response": "To analyze the inequality \n\n$$\n\\sqrt{a b c} + \\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \\quad () \\quad 1,\n$$ \n\nwe can denote:\n\n- \\( x = \\sqrt{a b c} \\)\n- \\( y = \\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \\)\n\n### Step 1: Determine the maximum value of \\( \\sqrt{a b c} \\)\n\nSince \\( a, b, c \\) are in the interval \\((0, 1)\\), it follows that \\( x \\) also falls within the interval (0, 1). \n\nBy the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{abc} \\leq \\frac{a + b + c}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the maximum value of \\( \\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \\)\n\nSimilarly, applying AM-GM to \\( 1-a, 1-b, 1-c \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \\leq \\frac{(1-a) + (1-b) + (1-c)}{3} = 1 - \\frac{a+b+c}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine both inequalities\n\nSince \\( \\sqrt{a b c} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \\) yield non-negative outputs that each can be less than 1, we would like to find their combined behavior when added together.\n\nSince both terms are constrained by their respective ranges, we evaluate their sum:\n\n1. Both \\( \\sqrt{a b c} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \\) will reach 1 only if either \\( a, b, c \\) are all 1 or all 0, neither of which is allowed since \\( (0, 1) \\) does not include endpoints.\n\n2. Specifically,\n   - \\( \\sqrt{abc} \\) approaches 1 when \\( a, b, c \\) are close to 1.\n   - \\( \\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} \\) approaches 1 when \\( a, b, c \\) are near 0.\n\nThus, each term can independently approach a maximum of 1 but cannot equal 1 at the same time given the constraints on \\( a, b, c \\).\n\n### Step 4: Analyze possible cases mathematically\n\nWe will check the extreme case when \\( a, b, c \\) are all equal:\n\nLet \\( a = b = c = k \\), where \\( k \\to 1 \\):\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{abc} = k^{3/2}, \\quad \\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} = (1-k)^{3/2} \\to 0\n$$\n\nThus, simplifying, \\( k^{3/2} + (1-k)^{3/2} < 1 \\).\n\nFor other combinations such that one variable approaches 0 while others approach 1, it can also be shown that the maximum possible sum is 1 but never equal to or exceed it.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the correct inequality based on these evaluations is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a b c} + \\sqrt{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)} < 1.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```'The answer is (D) $<$'```\n",
