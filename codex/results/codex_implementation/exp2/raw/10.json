One common strategy is to set \\( a = b = c = t > 0 \\). This leads to a simplified form of the inequality.\n\n2. **Substituting Equal Values**:\n   - With \\( a = b = c = t \\), the left-hand side becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\left(t^2 + \\frac{2(k+1)^2}{t+k}\\right)^3\n     \\]\n   - The right-hand side then becomes:\n     \\[\n     (Ck + 3)^3\n     \\]\n\n3. **Analyzing the Left-Hand Side**:\n   - We need to estimate \\( t^2 + \\frac{2(k+1)^2}{t+k} \\).\n   - Putting \\( k = 1 \\) as a specific value (the simplest case), we analyze:\n     \\[\n     t^2 + \\frac{4}{t+1}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Finding the Minimum**:\n   - Define \\( f(t) = t^2 + \\frac{4}{t+1} \\).\n   - To find the minimum of this function, we can take its derivative:\n     \\[\n     f'(t) = 2t - \\frac{4}{(t+1)^2}\n     \\]\n   - Setting the derivative to zero:\n     \\[\n     2t = \\frac{4}{(t+1)^2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2t(t+1)^2 = 4 \\implies 2t^3 + 4t^2 - 4 = 0 \\implies t^3 + 2t^2 - 2 = 0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Numerical Solutions**:\n   - The roots of the equation can be found using numerical methods or approximations.\n   - Testing small positive values shows that \\( t \\approx 1 \\) is a good approximation for a minimum leading to:\n     \\[\n     f(1) = 1^2 + \\frac{4}{2} = 1 + 2 = 3\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final Setup**:\n   - Thus, we find \\( (t^2 + \\frac{4}{t+1})^3 \\geq (C + 3)^3 \\).\n   - Setting \\( 3^3 \\geq (C + 3)^3 \\) implies:\n     \\[\n     27 \\geq (C + 3)^3\n     \\]\n\n7. **Solving for \\( C \\)**:\n   - Taking cube roots gives:\n     \\[\n     3 \\geq C + 3 \\implies C \\leq 0\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo the largest constant \\( C \\) that holds for the inequality is \\( 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the specified format is:\n\n```\n'The answer is $C=0$'\n```\n",
