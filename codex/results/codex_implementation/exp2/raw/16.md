Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the inequality given:

\[
\left(a^2+1\right)\left(b^2+1\right)\left(c^2+1\right) \geq (ab+bc+ca-abc)^2 + C \cdot abc
\]

We'll proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify the Left Side

The left side expands as follows:

\[
(a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)(c^2 + 1) = (a^2b^2c^2 + a^2b^2 + a^2 + b^2c^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 1)
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Right Side

The right side can be expressed as:

\[
(ab + bc + ca - abc)^2 = (ab + bc + ca)^2 - 2abc(ab + bc + ca) + a^2b^2c^2
\]

Substituting this into the inequality, we get:

\[
(a^2b^2c^2 + a^2b^2 + a^2 + b^2c^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 1) \geq (ab + bc + ca)^2 - 2abc(ab + bc + ca) + a^2b^2c^2 + C \cdot abc
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
a^2b^2 + a^2 + b^2c^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 1 \geq (ab + bc + ca)^2 - 2abc(ab + bc + ca) + (C + 1)abc
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate for Special Cases

To find the largest \( C \), we examine special values. Let \( a = b = c = 0 \):

\[
1 \geq 0 + 0
\]

This holds for any \( C \). 

Let \( a = b = c = 1 \):

\[
(1^2 + 1)(1^2 + 1)(1^2 + 1) = 2^3 = 8
\]

The right side evaluates to:

\[
(1 + 1 + 1 - 1)^2 + C \cdot 1 = 3^2 + C = 9 + C
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
8 \geq 9 + C \implies C \leq -1
\]

### Step 4: Further Evaluations

Let us try \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 0 \):

\[
(1^2 + 1)(1^2 + 1)(0^2 + 1) = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 4
\]

The right side is:

\[
(1 + 0 + 0 - 0)^2 + C \cdot 0 = 1^2 + 0 = 1
\]

This holds for any \( C \).

Let \( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \):

\[
(1^2 + 1)(0^2 + 1)(0^2 + 1) = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 2
\]

The right side is:

\[
(0 + 0 + 0 - 0)^2 + C \cdot 0 = 0 + 0 = 0
\]

This inequality holds true as well.

### Step 5: Optimal Value of C

The limiting case was \( C \leq -1 \) from \( a = b = c = 1 \). We have seen that no contradictions arise for \( C = -1 \) in other cases. Thus, the largest value satisfying the original inequality holds for non-negative real numbers is:

\[
C = -1
\]

### Final Answer

\[
\text{"The answer is } C=-1\text{"}
\]
