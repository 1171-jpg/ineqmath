Solution:

## Response

To find the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\frac{1}{b(a+b)} + \frac{1}{c(b+c)} + \frac{1}{a(c+a)} \geq \frac{C}{(a+b+c)^2}
\]

holds for all \( a, b, c > 0 \), we proceed through the following steps:

### Step 1: Transform the Inequality

We start by analyzing the left side of the inequality. Each term can be rewritten focusing on the symmetry of the variables:

\[
\frac{1}{b(a+b)} = \frac{1}{ab + b^2}
\]

Similarly for the other terms. 

### Step 2: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we can find a useful bound. For any non-negative reals \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) and positive \( y_1, y_2, y_3 \):

\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{y_i} \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \right) \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right)^2
\]

Let \( x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1, x_3 = 1 \) and let \( y_1 = b(a+b), y_2 = c(b+c), y_3 = a(c+a) \):

\[
\left( \frac{1}{b(a+b)} + \frac{1}{c(b+c)} + \frac{1}{a(c+a)} \right)(b(a+b) + c(b+c) + a(c+a)) \geq (1 + 1 + 1)^2 = 9
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the Expression

Now, we need to evaluate 

\[
b(a+b) + c(b+c) + a(c+a)
\]

Expanding it gives:

\[
ab + b^2 + bc + c^2 + ac + a^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + ab + ac + bc
\]

By the identity \( (a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc) \):

\[
b(a+b) + c(b+c) + a(c+a) = \frac{1}{2}((a+b+c)^2 + ab + ac + bc)
\]

### Step 4: Find the Maximum \( C \)

Now the inequality we derived can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{9}{\frac{1}{2}\left((a+b+c)^2 + ab + ac + bc \right)} \geq \frac{C}{(a+b+c)^2}
\]

Taking \( t = a+b+c \), we want:

\[
C \leq \frac{18}{1 + \frac{ab + ac + bc}{(a+b+c)^2}}
\]

### Step 5: Optimize the Bound

To achieve the maximum \( C \), we consider the minimum value of \( ab + ac + bc \) under conditions that keep per-variable symmetry intact. By the AM-GM inequality:

\[
ab + ac + bc \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{(abc)^2}
\]

So, in the alleviated conditions, it becomes \( \frac{C}{t^2} \). The worst-case scenario occurs when \( a = b = c \to t \). Thus, setting \( a = b = c = 1 \):

\[
\frac{3}{1(a+b)} = \frac{3}{2} \geq \frac{C}{(3)^2}
\]
Then:

\[
C \leq \frac{3 \cdot 9}{2} = \frac{27}{2}.
\]

### Conclusion:
After evaluating these boundaries along with checks against the derived inequalities, the conclusion can be made.

\[
\boxed{9}
\]

Thus, the maximum value of \( C \) is:
