Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
x(x-y)(z-x) \leq C
\]

for \( x, y, z \in [0, 1] \), we need to find the maximum value of the left-hand side over the specified ranges. We'll follow a series of steps to derive the minimal constant \( C \) that satisfies this inequality for all possible values of \( x, y, z \).

### Step 1: Analyze the function \( f(x, y, z) = x(x-y)(z-x) \)

- The function depends on \( x, y, z \), and we need to evaluate its behavior over the interval [0, 1].
- Each term can be analyzed:
  - \( x \) ranges from 0 to 1.
  - \( (x-y) \) reaches its maximum when \( y \) is minimized (i.e., \( y = 0 \)).
  - \( (z-x) \) is maximized when \( z \) is maximized (i.e., \( z = 1 \)).

### Step 2: Simplify the analysis

Let’s evaluate \( f(x, 0, 1) = x(x-0)(1-x) = x^2(1-x) \).

Now, the problem simplifies to maximizing 

\[
g(x) = x^2(1-x)
\]

for \( x \in [0, 1] \).

### Step 3: Find the maximum of \( g(x) \)

- To find the critical points, differentiate \( g(x) \):

\[
g'(x) = 2x(1-x) - x^2 = 2x - 3x^2
\]

- Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
2x - 3x^2 = 0
\]

Factoring out \( x \):

\[
x(2 - 3x) = 0
\]
Thus, \( x = 0 \) or \( x = \frac{2}{3} \).

- Evaluate \( g(x) \) at critical points and endpoints:

1. \( g(0) = 0^2(1-0) = 0 \)
2. \( g(1) = 1^2(1-1) = 0 \)
3. \( g\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2\left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{4}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{27} \)

### Step 4: Conclusion

The maximum value of \( g(x) \) over the interval [0, 1] is \( \frac{4}{27} \).

### Step 5: Identify the minimal constant \( C \)

Thus, the minimal constant \( C \) such that 

\[
x(x-y)(z-x) \leq C
\]

holds for all \( x, y, z \in [0, 1] \) is:

\[
C = \frac{4}{27}
\]

### Final Answer

The answer is \( C = \frac{4}{27} \). Therefore, the final statement is:

```
'The answer is $C=\frac{4}{27}$'
