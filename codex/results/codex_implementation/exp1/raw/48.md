## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq C
\]

for all values of \( x, y, z \) within the interval \( [-1, 3] \) satisfying the condition \( x + y + z = 3 \).

### Steps:

1. **Express \( z \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \)**:
   Using the equation \( x + y + z = 3 \), we can express \( z \) as:

   \[
   z = 3 - x - y
   \]

2. **Substitute \( z \) into the inequality**:
   We can rewrite \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) as follows:

   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (3 - x - y)^2
   \]

   Expanding the last term:

   \[
   (3 - x - y)^2 = 9 - 6x - 6y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2
   \]

   Substituting this back gives:

   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 9 - 6x - 6y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2
   \]

   Simplifying yields:

   \[
   2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy - 6x - 6y + 9
   \]

3. **Combining the terms**:
   We have:

   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2(x^2 + y^2 + xy) - 6(x + y) + 9
   \]

4. **Finding the maximum**:
   To find the maximal value, we substitute \( y = 3 - x - z \) into the expression and analyze \( x \) and \( z \). Since \( x + y + z = 3 \) limits the range of \( x \) and \( y \), we should analyze:

   - When \( x = -1, y = -1, z = 5 \) (not valid since \( z > 3 \)).
   - When \( x = 3, y = 0, z = 0 \).
   - Other combinations that stay within the bounds.

5. **Checking valid extremes**:
   Next, compute \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) at the boundaries:
   - For \( (3, 0, 0) \):
     
     \[
     3^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 9
     \]
   - For \( (1, 1, 1) \):

     \[
     1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
     \]
   - For \( (2, 1, 0) \):

     \[
     2^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 = 4 + 1 + 0 = 5
     \]
   - For \( (0, 0, 3) \):

     \[
     0^2 + 0^2 + 3^2 = 9
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   The maximum observed value occurs at both \( (3, 0, 0) \) and \( (0, 0, 3) \), suggesting \( C = 9 \).

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq C
\]

is:

```
The answer is $C=9$
