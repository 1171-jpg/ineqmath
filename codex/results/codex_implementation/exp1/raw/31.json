Consider the case when \\( a = b = c = d = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   7(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 7 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 112\n   \\]\n   And \\( abcd = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\) holds.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   Checking other combinations under \\( a \\geq b + 7c + d \\) demonstrates that the inequality still holds, confirming that the maximum \\( C \\) is achievable.\n\nThus, the solution to the problem states:\n\n```\nThe answer is $C=112$\n```\n",
