## Response

To find the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\frac{a+1}{a+b+1}+\frac{b+1}{b+c+1}+\frac{c+1}{c+a+1} \geq C
\]

for all non-negative \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a+b+c=3 \), we start by analyzing the inequality more closely.

**Step 1: Analyzing the expression**

The left-hand side consists of three fractions, each representing a part of \( a, b, c \). Notice that the denominators are sums of the variables plus one. We can evaluate specific cases to find a numerical bound.

**Step 2: Test cases**

1. **Case \( a = 3, b = 0, c = 0 \)**:
   \[
   \frac{3+1}{3+0+1}+\frac{0+1}{0+0+1}+\frac{0+1}{0+3+1} = \frac{4}{4} + 1 + \frac{1}{4} = 1 + 1 + 0.25 = 2.25
   \]

2. **Case \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 1 \)**:
   \[
   \frac{1+1}{1+1+1}+\frac{1+1}{1+1+1}+\frac{1+1}{1+1+1} = \frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{3} = 2
   \]

3. **Testing extremes, \( a = 0, b = 0, c = 3 \)** (similar to the first case):
   \[
   \frac{0+1}{0+0+1}+\frac{0+1}{0+3+1}+\frac{3+1}{3+0+1} = 1 + \frac{1}{4} + 1 = 2.25
   \]

4. **Case \( a = 1.5, b = 1.5, c = 0 \)**:
   \[
   \frac{1.5+1}{1.5+1.5+1}+\frac{1.5+1}{1.5+0+1} + \frac{0+1}{0+1.5+1} = \frac{2.5}{4.5} + \frac{2.5}{2.5} + \frac{1}{2.5} = \frac{5}{9} + 1 + \frac{2}{5} \approx 2.11
   \]

From these calculations, the smallest value observed for the left-hand side occurs when \( a = b = c = 1 \) or \( a = 3, b = 0, c = 0 \), yielding \( 2 \).

**Step 3: Establishing a lower bound**

We know that as \( C \) increases, the inequality must remain true for all combinations of non-negative \( a, b, c \) with \( a+b+c = 3 \). From our tests above, we see that \( C = 2 \) holds valid.

**Step 4: Conclusion**

We confirm that decreasing \( C \) lower than \( 2 \) would still satisfy the inequality. 

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c \) is:

\[
\text{"The answer is } C=2\text{"}
