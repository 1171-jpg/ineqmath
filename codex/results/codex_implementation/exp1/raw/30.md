Solution:

## Response

To determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\left(a+\frac{1}{a}\right)^2 + \left(b+\frac{1}{b}\right)^2 \geq C
\]

holds for all \( a, b > 0 \) with \( a + b = 1 \), we will first analyze the left-hand side of the inequality.

### Step 1: Express the terms in the inequality

We begin by analyzing the expression 

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2.
\]

Using the identity 

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} \geq 2 \quad \text{for } x > 0,
\]

we can derive:

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2 \geq 4.
\]

Hence,

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2 = a^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{a^2}.
\]

Similarly for \( b \):

\[
\left(b + \frac{1}{b}\right)^2 = b^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{b^2}.
\]

### Step 2: Combine the inequalities

Now summing both sides, we have:

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2 + \left(b + \frac{1}{b}\right)^2 \geq 4 + 4 = 8.
\]

So we find:

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2 + \left(b + \frac{1}{b}\right)^2 \geq 8.
\]

#### Special Case

Consider \( a = b = \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2} + 2\right)^2 = \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{4},
\]

so 

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2} + 2\right)^2 = \frac{25}{4}, \text{ and for } b:
\]

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2} + 2\right)^2 = \frac{25}{4}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2 + \left(b + \frac{1}{b}\right)^2 = 2 \times \frac{25}{4} = \frac{50}{4} = 12.5.
\]

### Step 3: Optimize the inequality

To ensure the minimum value of 

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2 + \left(b + \frac{1}{b}\right)^2 \geq C,
\]

we set \( C = 12.5 \) because we know that for \( a = b = \frac{1}{2} \), the sum achieves this bound of \( C \).

### Conclusion

The computed constant \( C \) satisfying the inequality for all positive \( a \) and \( b \) where \( a + b = 1 \) is thus:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = 12.5.
\]

Final formulation:

'"'The answer is $C=12.5$'"'
