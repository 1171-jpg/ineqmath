    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all positive real numbers \\( a, b, c \\) such that \\( abc = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Substitute Variables\nSince \\( abc = 1 \\), we can express \\( a, b, c \\) in terms of a single variable. We can set:\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{x}{y}, \\quad b = \\frac{y}{z}, \\quad c = \\frac{z}{x}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( x = a, y = b, z = c \\) are positive real numbers. This keeps \\( abc = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Rewrite the Expression\nNow, let's analyze the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} = \\frac{y}{x} + \\frac{z}{y} + \\frac{x}{z}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Apply the AM-GM Inequality\nTo find a lower bound for this expression, we can apply the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, which states:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x + y + z}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{xyz}\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y}{x} + \\frac{z}{y} + \\frac{x}{z} \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{y}{x} \\cdot \\frac{z}{y} \\cdot \\frac{x}{z}} = 3 \\sqrt[3]{1} = 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThis shows that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} \\geq 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest constant \\( C \\) that satisfies this inequality for all positive reals \\( a, b, c \\) such that \\( abc = 1 \\) is \n\n\\[\nC = 3.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the answer is \n\n\"'The answer is $C=3$'\".\n",
