## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\frac{1}{x+x^3} + \frac{1}{y+y^3} + \frac{1}{z+z^3} \quad () \quad \frac{9 \sqrt{2}}{4}
\]

given the constraint \(xy + yz + zx = 1\) for positive real numbers \(x, y, z\), we will first investigate the behavior of the function \(f(t) = \frac{1}{t + t^3}\).

### Step 1: Analyze the function \(f(t)\)

1. **Derivative**:
   To understand the behavior of \(f(t)\), we calculate its derivative.
   \[
   f'(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{t+t^3} \right) = -\frac{(1+3t^2)}{(t+t^3)^2}
   \]
   Since \(t > 0\), \(f'(t) < 0\) indicates that \(f(t)\) is a decreasing function.

### Step 2: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality 

We can analyze the sum using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. By applying Cauchy-Schwarz in the form of
\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 \right)\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i^2 \right) \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i \right)^2,
\]
we set \(a_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}, a_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+y^2}}, a_3 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z^2}}\) and normalize \(b_i\) so that the inequality can be applied.

### Step 3: Normalize using \(xy + yz + zx = 1\)

With \(xy + xz + yz = 1\), we explore values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) equal to \(x + y + z = k\). Thus, finding bounds for \(f(x), f(y), f(z)\) based on the constraint.

### Step 4: Use AM-GM inequality

Using the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality:
\[
x + y + z \geq 3\sqrt[3]{xyz}, \quad \text{let's denote it as } q = xyz.
\]

### Step 5: Testing exponential functions

Testing particular symmetric conditions (for instance, \(x = y = z = k\)) with \(3k^2 = 1\) gives \(k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\).

### Step 6: Calculate \(f(k)\)

With \(k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\):
1. Compute:
   \[
   f(k) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^3} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{1}{\frac{4}{3\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}
   \]

Then applying \(x = y = z\),
\[
\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{4} < \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{4}
\]
when calculated \(9\sqrt{3} < 9\sqrt{2}\).

### Conclusion

It follows:
\[
\frac{1}{x+x^3} + \frac{1}{y+y^3} + \frac{1}{z+z^3} \leq \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{4}
\]

Thus we have 

\[
\frac{1}{x+x^3} + \frac{1}{y+y^3} + \frac{1}{z+z^3} \leq \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{4}.
\]

So, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:
