Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we want to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{1}{1+a^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+b)} + \frac{1}{1+c^2} \geq C
\]

holds for all non-negative values of \( a, b, c \) satisfying the constraint \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \).

### Step 1: Establishing Bounds

Given the constraint \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \), we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and \( c \):

\[
b = 1 - a^2 - c^2
\]

Since \( a, b, c \geq 0 \), we have the bounds on \( a \) and \( c \):

- \( a^2 \leq 1 \)
- \( c^2 \leq 1 \) 

This means \( a \) and \( c \) can take values from 0 to 1.

### Step 2: Examine the Summands

Next, we analyze each part of the inequality:

1. **Term Analysis:**

   - For the first term \( \frac{1}{1+a^2} \):
     - The maximum occurs when \( a^2 \) is minimized (i.e., when \( a = 0 \)).
     - Thus, \( \frac{1}{1+a^2} \) can take a maximum value of 1.
  
   - For the second term \( \frac{1}{3(1+b)} \):
     - Substitute \( b = 1 - a^2 - c^2 \) to get:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3(1+(1-a^2-c^2))} = \frac{1}{3(2-a^2-c^2)}
     \]
     - The maximum occurs again when \( a^2+c^2 \) is minimized. The minimum occurs at the extremes where either \( a \) or \( c \) is zero. The maximum value approaches \( \frac{1}{3} \) when \( a^2 + c^2 \) is minimized (which can be shown later).
  
   - For the last term \( \frac{1}{1+c^2} \):
     - The maximum occurs when \( c^2 \) is minimized (i.e., \( c = 0 \)), leading to a maximum value of 1.

### Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Bound

Next, we need to calculate the total minimum together for the lowest values of \( C \):

Taking \( a = 0, c = 0 \) will give:

\[
b = 1 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{1+0^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+1)} + \frac{1}{1+0^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{6} + 1 = 2 + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{13}{6}
\]

This is a candidate for our minimum sum. 

Next, if both \( a \) and \( c \) are small, \( b \) approaches the maximum:

When \( a = 1, c = 0 \):
\[
b = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{1+1^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+0)} + \frac{1}{1+0} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + 1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{27}{6}
\]

Verifying smaller \( a, c \) could lead to checking fraction combinations approaching 1.

### Conclusions

Taking the minimal bound estimates calculated earlier:

The minimum total sum, therefore, can still confirm against values \( C = \frac{13}{12} \) approximately because we took the max accumulations.

### Result

Concluding from calculations, reminders that confirmed max states, we may conclude the most consistent evaluated numeric bounds provide:

\[
\boxed{\frac{13}{6}}
\]

Now stating the conclusion:

```
The answer is $C=\frac{13}{6}$.
