## Response

To solve the problem, we start by considering the given condition and the expression we need to analyze. We have:

\[
c^2 + d^2 = (a^2 + b^2)^3.
\]

We want to determine the inequality for the expression:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d}.
\]

### Step 1: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
(c^2 + d^2) \left( \frac{a^6}{c^2} + \frac{b^6}{d^2} \right) \geq \left( a^3 + b^3 \right)^2.
\]

### Step 2: Rearranging the Inequality

From the previous result, we can rearrange this to obtain:

\[
\frac{a^6}{c^2} + \frac{b^6}{d^2} \geq \frac{(a^3 + b^3)^2}{c^2 + d^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Substitute the Condition

Since \(c^2 + d^2 = (a^2 + b^2)^3\), we substitute this into our rearranged expression:

\[
\frac{a^6}{c^2} + \frac{b^6}{d^2} \geq \frac{(a^3 + b^3)^2}{(a^2 + b^2)^3}.
\]

### Step 4: Use AM-GM Inequality

Now, we also need to analyze \( \frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \). By applying the AM-GM inequality on the terms \(\frac{a^3}{c}\) and \(\frac{b^3}{d}\):

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \geq \frac{(a^3 + b^3)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{cd}}.
\]

### Step 5: Rearranging and Reasoning

We do not have a direct relationship yet, but we can combine the inequalities:

1. From the previous Cauchy-Schwarz step.
2. The AM-GM gives a positive lower bound.

### Conclusion

Intuitively, we know from the symmetrical nature and power comparisons in inequalities that:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \geq 1
\]

is fairly reasonable considering our setup leads to conditions that encompass symmetry and equality cases. However, exploring against the cubic inequality metrics might show strict inequalities.

Thus we conclude with:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \geq 1,
\]

and hence record the proposed answer as:

\[
\text{"The answer is (B) $\geq$"}
\]
