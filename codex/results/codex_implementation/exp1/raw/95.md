## Response

To solve the inequality problem, we start with the given equation involving positive real numbers \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
a^2 + b^2 + 3 = 4ab.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
a^2 - 4ab + b^2 + 3 = 0.
\]

This can be viewed as a quadratic in \( a \):

\[
a^2 - 4ab + (b^2 + 3) = 0.
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
a = \frac{4b \pm \sqrt{(4b)^2 - 4(b^2 + 3)}}{2}.
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
(4b)^2 - 4(b^2 + 3) = 16b^2 - 4b^2 - 12 = 12b^2 - 12 = 12(b^2 - 1).
\]

The discriminant \( 12(b^2 - 1) \) must be non-negative for \( a \) to be real, thus:

\[
b^2 - 1 \geq 0 \implies b \geq 1.
\]

Next, we apply the identity:

\[
2\sqrt{2ab} = \sqrt{8ab}, 
\]

and we want to compare:

\[
\sqrt{8ab} - \frac{1}{2}a - b \quad () \quad \frac{1}{2}.
\]

To do this, we set:

\[
x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ab}} \implies \frac{1}{2}a = \frac{b}{2}x^2.
\]

Substituting \( a \) in terms of \( b \):

\[
\sqrt{8ab} = 2\sqrt{2}b.
\]

Revisiting our inequality, we focus on:

\[
2\sqrt{2}b - \frac{b}{2}x^2 - b \quad () \quad \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
2\sqrt{2}b - b\left(\frac{x^2}{2} + 1\right) \quad () \quad \frac{1}{2}.
\]

We need to analyze \( x \):

Since \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ab}} \), we know that \( ab \) must be at least \( \frac{1}{1} \implies ab \leq 2\).

Now, consider when \( b = 1 \), \( a = 2 \):

Calculating gives:

\[
2\sqrt{2} - \frac{1}{2} \times 2 - 1 = 2 \sqrt{2} - 2 \quad ? \quad \frac{1}{2}.
\]
\[
2\sqrt{2} = 2 \times 1.414 \approx 2.828.
\]

This confirms:

\[
2\sqrt{2} - 2 \approx 0.828 > \frac{1}{2}.
\]

For values below \( b \) or \( a \), we observe that the relationship manifests continuously. Through calculation, we derive that:

\[
2\sqrt{2ab} - \frac{1}{2}a - b \geq \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Hence, the suitable inequality relation is:
