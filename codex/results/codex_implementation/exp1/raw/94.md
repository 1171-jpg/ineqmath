## Response

To solve the problem, we want to analyze the relationship between the inequality \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \) and \( 1 \), given the constraint \( a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 10 \).

### Step 1: Understanding the Constraint

Starting with the constraint:

\[
a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 10
\]

We can isolate \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \):

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 10 - (a + b)
\]

### Step 2: Bounding \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \)

Using the identity \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \geq \sqrt{2ab} \) (by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality):

\[
\sqrt{2ab} \leq 10 - (a + b)
\]

Squaring both sides gives:

\[
2ab \leq (10 - a - b)^2
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
2ab \leq 100 - 20a - 20b + a^2 + 2ab + b^2
\]

Subtract \( 2ab \) from both sides:

\[
0 \leq 100 - 20a - 20b + a^2 + b^2
\]

Rearranging yields:

\[
a^2 + b^2 - 20a - 20b + 100 \geq 0
\]

### Step 3: Analyzing the Expression 

Now, let's analyze \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \). To find a lower bound for this expression, we can apply the method of Lagrange multipliers or testing critical points.

### Step 4: Using the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality for the terms \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \):

\[
(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b})(a + b) \geq (1 + 2)^2 = 9
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq \frac{9}{a + b}
\]

Now, we also know from our constraint:

\[
a + b \leq 10 - \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

Thus the minimum condition \( a + b \) can lead us to higher values for the fractional terms.

### Step 5: Final Steps

We conclude \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \) will approach values larger than 1 as \( a \) and \( b \) are such that the constraint holds.

### Result

Thus, the direction of the inequality is:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq 1
\]

The answer is:

```
'The answer is (B) ≥'
