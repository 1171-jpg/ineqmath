## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the condition given:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4.
\]

Next, we need to analyze the left-hand side of the inequality:

\[
\frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d}.
\]

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} + \frac{1}{x_3} + \frac{1}{x_4} \right) \left( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 \right) \geq (1 + 1 + 1 + 1)^2.
\]

In our case, let \( x_1 = 5-a \), \( x_2 = 5-b \), \( x_3 = 5-c \), and \( x_4 = 5-d \). We calculate:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d} \right) \cdot \left( (5-a) + (5-b) + (5-c) + (5-d) \right) \geq 16.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d} \right) \cdot \left( 20 - (a + b + c + d) \right) \geq 16.
\]

Thus, we need to find the expression for \( a + b + c + d \). By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
(a + b + c + d)^2 \leq (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) = 4 \cdot 4 = 16.
\]

This implies:

\[
a + b + c + d \leq 4,
\]

and by the Cauchy-Schwarz in equality, we know \( a + b + c + d \) can achieve its maximum when \( a = b = c = d \). This gives:

\[
a + b + c + d \leq 4 \Rightarrow 20 - (a + b + c + d) \geq 16.
\]

Substituting this back, we have:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d} \right) \cdot 16 \geq 16 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d} \geq 1.
\]

So, we are comparing this with \(\frac{5}{4} = 1.25\).

To determine the relationship:

Since 
\[
\frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d} \geq 1,
\]
and since 1 is less than 1.25, we conclude:

\[
\frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d} < \frac{5}{4}.
\]

Thus the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
\text{The answer is (D) } <.
\]
