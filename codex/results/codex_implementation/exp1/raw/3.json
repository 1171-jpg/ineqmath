    "response": "Given the condition \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(ab + ac + bc) \\), we can reformulate it:\n\n1. **Rearranging the Condition**:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 0\n   \\]\n   This can be rewritten using the quadratic form:\n   \\[\n   (a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   This implies \\( a = b = c \\).\n\n2. **Substituting Variables**:\n   Let \\( a = b = c = k \\) (for some \\( k \\neq 0 \\)). Then we can substitute into the inequality:\n   \\[\n   (k + k + k) \\left( \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 3k \\cdot \\frac{3}{k}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we find:\n   \\[\n   3k \\cdot \\frac{3}{k} = 9\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the inequality holds as:\n   \\[\n   9 \\geq C\n   \\]\n\n3. **Establishing the Value of \\( C \\)**:\n   The inequality must hold true for all \\( a, b, c \\) satisfying the original condition. Since we have shown that when \\( a = b = c \\), the expression evaluates to \\( 9 \\), the maximum value for \\( C \\) must be \\( 9 \\).\n\n   Thus, the largest constant \\( C \\) satisfying the inequality is:\n   \\[\n   C = 9\n   \\]\n\nFinally, concluding the solution, we state:\n'\"'\"'The answer is $C=9$'\"'\"'.\n",
