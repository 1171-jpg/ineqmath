    "response": "To determine the largest constant \\( C \\) such that \n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^3}{x-4} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all \\( x > 4 \\), we will analyze the expression \\( \\frac{x^3}{x-4} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Function\n\nWe first express the function in terms of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{x^3}{x-4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the Limit as \\( x \\to 4^+ \\)\n\nAs \\( x \\to 4^+ \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{4^3}{4-4} \\to \\infty\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that \\( f(x) \\) approaches infinity as \\( x \\) approaches 4 from the right. Thus the function \\( f(x) \\) does not have any lower bound approaching \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Behavior as \\( x \\) Increases\n\nNow we will evaluate the function at large values of \\( x \\):\n\nAs \\( x \\) becomes large:\n\n\\[\nf(x) \\to \\frac{x^3}{x} = x^2\n\\]\n\nThis implies that as \\( x \\to \\infty \\), \\( f(x) \\) will also approach infinity, indicating there is no global minimum for large values of \\( x \\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding a Lower Bound for \\( C \\)\n\nNow we need to determine if there exists a constant \\( C \\) such that \\( f(x) \\geq C \\). We can find the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) for \\( x > 4 \\) by considering the derivative:\n\n#### Step 4.1: Differentiate \\( f(x) \\)\n\nUsing the quotient rule to differentiate \\( f(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{(x-4)(3x^2) - x^3(1)}{(x-4)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{3x^2(x-4) - x^3}{(x-4)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{3x^3 - 12x^2 - x^3}{(x-4)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{2x^3 - 12x^2}{(x-4)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{2x^2(x - 6)}{(x-4)^2}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4.2: Set the Derivative to Zero\n\nTo find critical points, set \\( f'(x) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n2x^2(x - 6) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us \\( x = 0 \\), \\( x = 6 \\) (we discard \\( x = 0 \\) since we are only interested in \\( x > 4 \\)).\n\n#### Step 4.3: Evaluate \\( f(x) \\) at \\( x = 6 \\)\n\nNow calculate \\( f(6) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(6) = \\frac{6^3}{6-4} = \\frac{216}{2} = 108\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Confirm \\( C = 108 \\)\n\nSince we've confirmed that at \\( x = 6 \\), the function's minimum value is \\( 108 \\) for \\( x > 4 \\), we conclude that:\n\n\\[\nC = 108\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```\n'The answer is $C=108$'\n```\n",
