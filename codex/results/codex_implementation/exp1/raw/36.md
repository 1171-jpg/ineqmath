Solution:

## Response

To find the largest constant \( C \) satisfying the inequality 

\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{C}+\frac{b}{x+y} \geq 1+\frac{b}{2}
\]

for all positive real numbers \( x, y \) such that \( xy = 1 \), let's first express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[
y = \frac{1}{x}
\]

Now, we can substitute this into the terms \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and \( x + y \):

1. **Calculate \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \)**:
   \[
   \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{x^4 + 1}{x^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{x^4 + 1}}{x}
   \]
   
2. **Calculate \( x + y \)**:
   \[
   x + y = x + \frac{1}{x}
   \]

Substituting into the inequality, we rewrite it as:

\[
\frac{\frac{\sqrt{x^4 + 1}}{x}}{C} + \frac{b}{x + \frac{1}{x}} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^4 + 1}}{Cx} + \frac{b}{x + \frac{1}{x}} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

To find the bounds for \( C \), we need to analyze the terms as \( x \) varies. Notice that \( x + \frac{1}{x} \) attains its minimum value of \( 2 \) when \( x = 1 \).

### Step 1: Evaluate at \( x = 1 \)

Let’s check the case when \( x = 1 \) (hence \( y = 1 \)):
- We have:
  - \( \sqrt{x^4 + 1} = \sqrt{2} \)
  - \( x + y = 2 \)

Substituting into the inequality:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{C} + \frac{b}{2} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{C} \geq 1
\]

Thus, we arrive at:

\[
C \leq \sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 2: Check for larger values of \( x \)

As \( x \to 0 \) or \( x \to \infty \), \( \sqrt{x^4 + 1} \) approaches \( x^2 \) or \( \frac{1}{x^2} \), respectively:

\[
\sqrt{x^4 + 1} \approx x^2 \quad \text{(as } x \to \infty\text{)}
\]

In both cases, because of the nature of \( \frac{b}{x + \frac{1}{x}} \):

- As \( x \to 0 \): the term \( x + \frac{1}{x} \) goes to infinity, making the \(\frac{b}{x + \frac{1}{x}} \) term approach \( 0 \).
- As \( x \to \infty \): the same occurs.

In both extremes, we reaffirm the bound \( C \leq \sqrt{2} \).

### Conclusion

Given all evaluations and ensuring the conditions of \( b \) (where \( b \leq 2 \)) do not exceed the calculated bound, we conclude that the largest constant \( C \) satisfying the inequality for all \( b \leq 2 \) is:

\[
C = \sqrt{2}
\]

Finally, encapsulating this in the required format:

```
The answer is $C=\sqrt{2}$
