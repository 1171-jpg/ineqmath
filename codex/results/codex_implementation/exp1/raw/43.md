Problem: Let $a, b, c$ be real numbers such that $a^2 + bc = 1$. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that

\[
\frac{1}{a^2+1} + \frac{1}{b^2+1} + \frac{1}{c^2+1} \leq C
\]

holds for all real numbers \( a, b, c \) satisfying the constraint \( a^2 + bc = 1 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Constraint
From the constraint \( a^2 + bc = 1 \), we can express \( bc = 1 - a^2 \). The values of \( b \) and \( c \) directly depend on \( a \).

### Step 2: Find Maximum Values
We need to analyze how the fractional expressions \( \frac{1}{a^2 + 1} \), \( \frac{1}{b^2 + 1} \), and \( \frac{1}{c^2 + 1} \) behave under the constraint.

1. **Function Analysis**: Each term \( \frac{1}{x^2 + 1} \) is a decreasing function of \( x \). To minimize \( b^2 \) and \( c^2 \), we can make \( a \) as small as possible while still satisfying \( a^2 + bc = 1 \).

2. **Examine Extreme Cases**: 
   - Consider \( a = 1 \): Then \( b = c = 0 \), which gives:
     \[
     \frac{1}{1^2 + 1} + \frac{1}{0^2 + 1} + \frac{1}{0^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{2} + 1 + 1 = \frac{5}{2}
     \]
   - Consider \( a = 0 \): Then \( bc = 1 \). We can set \( b = 1 \) and \( c = 1 \) (or any other combination such that \( bc = 1 \)):
     \[
     \frac{1}{0^2 + 1} + \frac{1}{1^2 + 1} + \frac{1}{1^2 + 1} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 2
     \]

3. **Summary of Values**: The calculated values suggest:
   - From \( a = 0, b = 1, c = 1 \): Total was \( 2 \).
   - From \( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \): Total was \( \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \).

### Step 3: Conclusion on the Constant \( C \)
The maximum of these evaluated sums gives the value of \( C \):
- The maximum observed was \( \frac{5}{2} \).

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) satisfying the inequality for all valid \( a, b, c \) is:

\[
\boxed{C = \frac{5}{2}}
\]

### Final Statement
The answer is 

```
'The answer is $C=\frac{5}{2}$'
