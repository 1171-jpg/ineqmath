Problem: Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(x+1)(y+2) = 8$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y$ satisfying the given constraint:

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the equation given by the constraint:

\[
(x + 1)(y + 2) = 8
\]

Expanding this, we have:

\[
xy + 2x + y + 2 = 8 \implies xy + 2x + y = 6
\]

We want to find the constant \( C \) such that:

\[
|xy - 10| \geq C
\]

This can be rewritten as two inequalities:

\[
xy - 10 \geq C \quad \text{and} \quad - (xy - 10) \geq C \implies xy \leq 10 - C
\]

From here, we can express \( xy \) in terms of \( C \):

\[
C \leq xy - 10 \quad \text{and} \quad xy \leq 10 + C
\]

To understand the bounds on \( xy \), we need to analyze the expression \( xy \) under the constraint \( (x+1)(y+2) = 8 \).

We can isolate \( y \) from the constraint:

\[
y + 2 = \frac{8}{x + 1} \implies y = \frac{8}{x + 1} - 2
\]

Thus,

\[
xy = x\left(\frac{8}{x + 1} - 2\right) = \frac{8x}{x + 1} - 2x
\]

Rearranging gives us:

\[
xy = \frac{8x - 2x(x + 1)}{x + 1} = \frac{8x - 2x^2 - 2x}{x + 1} = \frac{-2x^2 + 6x}{x + 1}
\]

This can also be written as:

\[
xy = -2x + \frac{6x}{x + 1}
\]

Next, we find the critical points of \( xy \) by maximizing or minimizing \( xy \) given the constraint. We'll use the Lagrange multipliers method to find extrema of \( xy \).

We replace \( y \) with \( \frac{8}{x + 1} - 2 \) in the objective function and find the derivative:

1. Define \( f(x) = \frac{-2x^2 + 6x}{x + 1} \).
2. Take the derivative and set it to zero:

Using the quotient rule:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{(-4x + 6)(x + 1) + (2x^2 - 6x)}{(x + 1)^2}
\]

Setting the numerator equal to zero:

\[
-4x^2 + 6x + -4x + 6 = 0 \implies -4x^2 + 2x + 6 = 0
\]

Solving for \( x \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):

\[
x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(-4)(6)}}{2(-4)} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 96}}{-8} = \frac{-2 \pm 10}{-8}
\]

Calculating gives:

\[
x_1 = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad x_2 = -\frac{3}{4}
\]

Now, substituting these \( x \) values back into the equation for \( y \):

- For \( x = 1 \):

\[
y = \frac{8}{1 + 1} - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 \implies xy = 1 \cdot 2 = 2
\]

- For \( x = -\frac{3}{4} \):

\[
y = \frac{8}{\frac{1}{4}} - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30 \implies xy = -\frac{3}{4} \cdot 30 = -\frac{90}{4} = -22.5
\]

So the bounds for \( xy \) we have obtained are \( 2 \) and \( -22.5 \). 

Finally, we find the minimum absolute value:

1. At \( xy = 2 \), \( |xy - 10| = |2 - 10| = 8 \).
2. At \( xy = -22.5 \), \( |xy - 10| = |-22.5 - 10| = 32.5 \).

Therefore, \( C \) must be less than or equal to the minimum between these two values:

Since we want the largest constant \( C \):

\[
C = 8
\]

Putting it in the required format:

'The answer is $C=8$'
