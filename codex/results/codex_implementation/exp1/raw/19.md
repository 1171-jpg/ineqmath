Problem: Given positive real numbers $a, b, c$ satisfying $ab + bc + ca = 3$, find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{c+a}} \geq \sqrt{\frac{C}{a+b+c+3}}
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \) subject to the condition \( ab + bc + ca = 3 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Condition

Given \( ab + bc + ca = 3 \), we should explore the implications of this condition for the expressions involved.

### Step 2: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that 

\[
\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i^2}{y_i}\right) \left(\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\right) \geq \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\right)^2.
\]

Applying this to our case,

\[
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{c+a}} \right)^2 \cdot ((a+b) + (b+c) + (c+a)) \geq \left(3\right)^2.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{c+a}} \right)^2 \cdot (2(a+b+c)) \geq 9.
\]

### Step 3: Further Evaluation Based on the Condition

From the above,
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{c+a}} \geq \frac{3}{\sqrt{2(a+b+c)}}.
\]

### Step 4: Express The Right Side with \( C \)

To match terms, we want:

\[
\frac{3}{\sqrt{2(a+b+c)}} \geq \sqrt{\frac{C}{a+b+c+3}}.
\]

Squaring both sides gives:

\[
\frac{9}{2(a+b+c)} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c+3}.
\]

### Step 5: Cross-Multiply and Simplify

This leads to:

\[
9(a+b+c+3) \geq 2C(a+b+c).
\]

Rearranging yields:

\[
9a + 9b + 9c + 27 \geq 2Ca + 2Cb + 2Cc.
\]

### Step 6: Select Values for \( a, b, c \)

To find the largest \( C \), consider simplifying cases such as \( a = b = c = 1 \) (since \( 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 = 3 \)). Therefore, \( a+b+c = 3 \).

Plugging this into our inequality:

\[
\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \geq \sqrt{\frac{C}{3+3}} \implies \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \geq \sqrt{\frac{C}{6}},
\]

Squaring both sides results in:

\[
\frac{9}{2} \geq \frac{C}{6} \implies C \leq 27.
\]

### Conclusion: Calculate \( C \)

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) is 

\[
C = 27.
\]

### Final Statement

The answer is 

'"'"'The answer is $C=27$'"'"'.
