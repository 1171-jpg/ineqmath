## Response

To solve the inequality \( a^5 + 16b^5 \) in the context of \( a + b = 1 \) and \( a, b \geq 0 \), we can proceed with the following steps:

### 1. Substitute for \( b \)
Since \( b = 1 - a \), we can rewrite the expression:
\[
a^5 + 16(1 - a)^5.
\]

### 2. Expand \( (1 - a)^5 \)
Using the binomial theorem:
\[
(1 - a)^5 = 1 - 5a + 10a^2 - 10a^3 + 5a^4 - a^5.
\]
Now multiplying by 16:
\[
16(1 - a)^5 = 16 - 80a + 160a^2 - 160a^3 + 80a^4 - 16a^5.
\]

### 3. Combine the expression
Putting everything together:
\[
a^5 + 16(1 - a)^5 = a^5 + (16 - 80a + 160a^2 - 160a^3 + 80a^4 - 16a^5).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-15a^5 + 80a^4 + 160a^2 - 80a + 16.
\]

### 4. Analyze the function
To analyze \( -15a^5 + 80a^4 + 160a^2 - 80a + 16 \):
We can find the maximum and evaluate the critical points. Since the expressions might become complicated, we can evaluate specific values of \( a \):

- For \( a = 0 \):
  \[
  a^5 + 16b^5 = 16 \cdot 1^5 = 16.
  \]

- For \( a = 1 \):
  \[
  a^5 + 16b^5 = 1^5 + 16 \cdot 0^5 = 1.
  \]

- For \( a = \frac{1}{2} \):
  \[
  a^5 + 16b^5 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^5 + 16 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^5 = 1 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^5 + 16 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^5 = 17 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{32} \right) = \frac{17}{32} \approx 0.53125.
  \]

### 5. Check limits
Evaluate \( a^5 + 16b^5 \) as \( a \) approaches any boundary:
- As \( a \to 0 \), \( a^5 + 16b^5 \to 16\).
- As \( a \to 1 \), \( a^5 + 16b^5 \to 1\).

### Conclusion
The maximum value of \( a^5 + 16b^5 \) is 16 when \( b = 1 \) (and \( a = 0 \)). Since \( 16 > \frac{1}{6} \), the conclusion reached is:
\[
a^5 + 16b^5 \geq \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, the correct relation is:

**The answer is (B) $\geq$**.
