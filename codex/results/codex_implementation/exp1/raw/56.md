## Response

To determine the correct inequality involving the expression 

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2} \quad () \quad n^2 + n,
\]

given that \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n > 0 \) and \( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1 \), we can analyze the expression systematically.

### Step-by-step Analysis

1. **Rewrite the expression**: Break down the sum.
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2} = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} + \frac{n}{1+x_i^2} \right)
   \]
   So we consider:
   \[
   S_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2}, \quad S_2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{1+x_i^2}
   \]

2. **Estimate \( S_1 \)**:
   - For small \( x_i \), \( \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} \) is approximately \( x_i \) which remains small.
   - As \( x_i \) approaches large values, \( \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} \to 0 \).
   - Thus, we can explore an inequality with \( S_1 \leq \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1 \).

3. **Estimate \( S_2 \)**:
   \[
   S_2 = n \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{1+x_i^2}.
   \]
   Using \( a = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1 \), the term \( \frac{1}{1+x_i^2} \) will significantly depend on the size of \( x_i \).

4. **Using Jensen's Inequality**:
   Given that \( \frac{1}{1+x^2} \) is a convex function,
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \cdot \frac{n}{1+x_i^2} \geq \frac{n}{1 + \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\right)^2} = \frac{n}{1 + 1} = \frac{n}{2}.
   \]

5. **Putting together the components**:
   Thus, we conjecture:
   \[
   S_1 + S_2 \geq n + \frac{1}{2}n.
   \]
   However, rearranging gives:
   \[
   S_1 + S_2 < n^2 + n.
   \]

### Conclusion
After analyzing the inequalities and bounds generated from \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \), we observe:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2} < n^2 + n.
\]
