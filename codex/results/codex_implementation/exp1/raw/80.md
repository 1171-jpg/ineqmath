## Response

To solve the problem, we'll analyze the inequality involving the cyclic sum and check the validity of the expressions for non-negative real numbers \(a, b, c\) subject to the constraint \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3\).

### Step 1: Analyze the cyclic sum
The cyclic sum is given by:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{a}{a+2} = \frac{a}{a+2} + \frac{b}{b+2} + \frac{c}{c+2}
\]

### Step 2: Bound each term
Each term \(\frac{a}{a+2}\) can be bounded as follows:
- When \(a = 0\), \(\frac{a}{a+2} = 0\).
- When \(a > 0\), observe that:
\[
\frac{a}{a+2} < 1
\]

The maximum value of \(\frac{a}{a+2}\) approaches 1 as \(a\) becomes very large, but is always less than 1 for \(a < \infty\).

### Step 3: Evaluate the upper bound
Let’s evaluate the expression. Since \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3\), we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[
(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)\left(\frac{1}{(a+2)^2} + \frac{1}{(b+2)^2} + \frac{1}{(c+2)^2}\right) \geq \left(\frac{a}{a+2} + \frac{b}{b+2} + \frac{c}{c+2}\right)^2
\]

This gives us an upper limit on the sum of fractions.

### Step 4: Using Known Results
Another useful approach is to apply Jensen's inequality because the function \(f(x) = \frac{x}{x+2}\) is concave for \(x \geq 0\). From Jensen's inequality, we know that:

\[
f(a) + f(b) + f(c) \leq 3f\left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)
\]

By substituting \(x = \frac{a+b+c}{3}\), we need to estimate \(a + b + c\) under the square constraint. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again:

\[
(a+b+c)^2 \leq 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 9 \implies a+b+c \leq 3
\]

### Step 5: Evaluate \(f\left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)\)
Taking this into account:

\[
f\left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right) = \frac{\frac{a+b+c}{3}}{\frac{a+b+c}{3} + 2} = \frac{\frac{a+b+c}{3}}{\frac{a+b+c + 6}{3}} = \frac{a+b+c}{a+b+c + 6}
\]

### Step 6: Check the boundary conditions
For the boundary condition, when \(a = b = c = 1\), we have:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{1}{1+2} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, we derive that:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{a}{a+2} \leq 1
\]

Putting this together, the final inequality we fill in the blank will be:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{a}{a+2} \leq 1
\]

The correct option is therefore (A).

Thus, the answer is:

'''
The answer is (A) $\leq$
