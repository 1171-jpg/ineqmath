## Response

To solve the problem, we will analyze the two expressions given the condition \(abc = 1\). 

### Step 1: Manipulating the expressions

- The first expression is:
  \[
  a^3 + b^3 + 2c^3
  \]

- The second expression is:
  \[
  a^2 + b^2 + c^2
  \]

### Step 2: Apply the AM-GM inequality

Given \(abc = 1\), we can relate the terms \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean):

1. By AM-GM, we know:
   \[
   a^3 + b^3 + 2c^3 \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{a^3 b^3 (c^3)^2}
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   a^3 + b^3 + 2c^3 \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{(abc)^3 c^3} = 3\sqrt[3]{c^3} = 3c
   \]

2. Also using AM-GM separately on \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\):
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{(a^2)(b^2)(c^2)} = 3\sqrt[3]{(abc)^2} = 3\sqrt[3]{1^2} = 3
   \]

### Step 3: Comparing the results

Now we need to compare \(a^3 + b^3 + 2c^3\) and \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\).

- From \(a^3 + b^3 + 2c^3 \geq 3c\) and the relationship between \(c\) and \(3\) from \(a^2+b^2+c^2\), we find:

If \(c = 1\), we have:
\[
a^3 + b^3 + 2 \geq a^2 + b^2 + 1
\]
But, since \(abc = 1\), we can set \(a = b\) leading to \(c = \frac{1}{a^2}\).

- By substituting \(a = b\) for simplicity:
\[
2a^3 + 2 \left(\frac{1}{a^2}\right)^3
\]
Now we have:
\[
2a^3 + \frac{2}{a^6}
\]

### Step 4: Analyzing limits and values

Let's take the case where \(a, b, c\) approach specific values. For instance, when \(a = b = c = 1\), both expressions equal \(3\).

For \(a\) or \(b\) tending towards zero, the left expression can grow larger relative to the right-hand side, indicating more complex behavior depending on how they diverge or converge.

### Conclusion

If we compute specific examples and general cases, maintaining all conditions, it appears plausible that:
\[
a^3 + b^3 + 2c^3 > a^2 + b^2 + c^2
\]
is generally true given specific conditions on the magnitudes of \(a, b, c\).

Thus, the expression can be reasonably concluded to be:
"Inequality of the form given by:

\[
\text{The answer is (B) } \geq
\]"

And that provides a general trend across valid cases explored. 

### Final Answer:

`'The answer is (B) ≥'`
