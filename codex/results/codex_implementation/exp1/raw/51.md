## Response

To analyze the inequality:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \quad () \quad \frac{5a}{2a^2 + b^2 + c^2} + \frac{5b}{a^2 + 2b^2 + c^2} + \frac{5c}{a^2 + b^2 + 2c^2},
\]

we will explore both sides in depth to find their relationship.

### Step 1: Consider the Left Side

The left side of the inequality is:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}.
\]

This expression can be simplified and interpreted as the sum of the reciprocals of positive numbers, which emphasizes the contributions of smaller values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

### Step 2: Consider the Right Side

The right side is:

\[
\frac{5a}{2a^2 + b^2 + c^2} + \frac{5b}{a^2 + 2b^2 + c^2} + \frac{5c}{a^2 + b^2 + 2c^2}.
\]

Each term can be thought of in terms of a weighted average, where the numerator is scaled by 5 times the respective variable, suggesting influence from that variable upon the inequality.

### Step 3: Inequality and Homogenization

Given that the right side looks like a homogeneous function of degree 0, we can analyze it further. We apply techniques from inequalities, specifically the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. For any positive \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

By Cauchy-Schwarz, we have:

\[
(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \left( \frac{5}{2a^2 + b^2 + c^2} + \frac{5}{a^2 + 2b^2 + c^2} + \frac{5}{a^2 + b^2 + 2c^2} \right) \geq (5)^{2} = 25.
\]

This gives us a strong condition about the relationship between the left and right sides when multiplied by \((a + b + c)\).

### Step 4: Compare Terms 

We observe that left side terms tend to lead to:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} = \frac{bc + ca + ab}{abc},
\]

inferring a relation of weighted products.

### Step 5: Evaluate Options 

Comparing the two sides under various substitutions (say \(a=b=c=1\) or letting one variable dominate), we can find consistent inequalities. Specifically:

1. Testing \(a = b = c\), we notice clearly that the terms balance out \( \Rightarrow LHS \leq RHS\).
  
2. In scenarios where \(a,b,c\) exhibit increasing differences, especially supposing \(a\) is very small compared to \(b\) and \(c\), the left-hand side increases significantly while the right side remains contained, affirming \(LHS \leq RHS\).

### Conclusion

The inequalities hold across scenarios, suggesting:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \leq \frac{5a}{2a^2 + b^2 + c^2} + \frac{5b}{a^2 + 2b^2 + c^2} + \frac{5c}{a^2 + b^2 + 2c^2}.
\]

Thus, filling in the blank yields:

'"'"'The answer is (A) $\leq$'"'"'.
