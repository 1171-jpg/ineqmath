## Response

To solve the problem of finding the largest constant \( C \) for the inequality 

\[
\left(\frac{a}{b+c}\right)^2 + \frac{b}{c+a} + \left(\frac{c}{a+b}\right)^2 \geq C,
\]

for all \( a, b, c > 0 \), we can proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Analyze Special Cases

Start by testing specific values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

#### Case 1: \( a = b = c = 1 \)

Substituting \( a = b = c = 1 \) gives:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{1+1}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{1+1} + \left(\frac{1}{1+1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2.
\]

Calculating this yields:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = 1.
\]

Thus, the value can be at least \( 1 \) when \( a = b = c = 1 \).

#### Case 2: More General Testing

Now, let’s consider when two variables are equal and the third is varied, for example, let \( a = b = 1 \) and \( c \to 0 \):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{1+0}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{0+1} + \left(\frac{0}{1+1}\right)^2 = 1^2 + 1 + 0 = 2.
\]

### Step 2: Generalization and Boundary Exploration

To find a more rigorous argument, consider the function:

\[
f(a, b, c) = \left(\frac{a}{b+c}\right)^2 + \frac{b}{c+a} + \left(\frac{c}{a+b}\right)^2.
\]

- \( f \) can be expressed in terms of ratios, highlighting potential symmetry.
- Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any non-negative reals \( x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 \):

\[
\frac{x_1^2}{y_1} + \frac{x_2^2}{y_2} \geq \frac{(x_1 + x_2)^2}{y_1 + y_2}.
\]

### Step 3: Set Boundaries

Using \( a = 1, b = 1, c \to 0 \):

The resulting simplified case still holds \( f(1, 1, 0) = 2 \).

### Step 4: Ensuring Minimality

To confirm that \( C = 1 \) is indeed the largest constant, we need to check whether any combination less than 1 is achievable via limits and general \( a, b, c \) configurations. 

- Any configurations tending towards boundaries (where one or two variables approach 0) yield higher values than 1 confirming that:
\[
C = 1
\]

is achievable and that no lesser constant can produce a counterexample or breaching point.

### Conclusion

Verifying edge cases, symmetry, and inequality utilities suggest \( 1 \) is indeed the lower bound across all valid \( a, b, c > 0 \):

Thus, 

\[
\text{The answer is } C=1.
\] 

Final statement:

```plaintext
The answer is $C=1$
