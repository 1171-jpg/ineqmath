Solution:

## Response

Given the condition \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(ab + ac + bc) \), we can reformulate it:

1. **Rearranging the Condition**:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 0
   \]
   This can be rewritten using the quadratic form:
   \[
   (a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2 = 0
   \]
   This implies \( a = b = c \).

2. **Substituting Variables**:
   Let \( a = b = c = k \) (for some \( k \neq 0 \)). Then we can substitute into the inequality:
   \[
   (k + k + k) \left( \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} \right) = 3k \cdot \frac{3}{k}
   \]
   Simplifying, we find:
   \[
   3k \cdot \frac{3}{k} = 9
   \]
   Therefore, the inequality holds as:
   \[
   9 \geq C
   \]

3. **Establishing the Value of \( C \)**:
   The inequality must hold true for all \( a, b, c \) satisfying the original condition. Since we have shown that when \( a = b = c \), the expression evaluates to \( 9 \), the maximum value for \( C \) must be \( 9 \).

   Thus, the largest constant \( C \) satisfying the inequality is:
   \[
   C = 9
   \]

Finally, concluding the solution, we state:
'"'"'The answer is $C=9$'"'"'.
