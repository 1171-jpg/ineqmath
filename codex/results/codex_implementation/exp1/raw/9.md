Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that

\[
\frac{a^3 + 2b^3 + 2c^3}{abc} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a \geq b + c \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Inequality

First, we rewrite the inequality:

\[
\frac{a^3}{abc} + \frac{2b^3}{abc} + \frac{2c^3}{abc} \geq C
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{2b^2}{ac} + \frac{2c^2}{ab} \geq C
\]

### Step 2: Use Known Relationships

Since \( a \geq b + c \), we can substitute \( a \) to explore the relationship more closely. Let's assume \( a = b + c + \epsilon \) for some small positive \( \epsilon \). Thus, we can analyze the case when \( \epsilon \) approaches 0.

### Step 3: Test Specific Values

To find a pattern, we can test specific cases.

1. **Case 1:** Let \( b = c = 1 \) and \( a = 2 \).
   \[
   LHS = \frac{2^3 + 2 \cdot 1^3 + 2 \cdot 1^3}{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = \frac{8 + 2 + 2}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
   \]

2. **Case 2:** Let \( b = c = 1 \) and \( a = 3 \).
   \[
   LHS = \frac{3^3 + 2 \cdot 1^3 + 2 \cdot 1^3}{3 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = \frac{27 + 2 + 2}{3} = \frac{31}{3} \approx 10.33
   \]

3. **Case 3:** Let \( b = 1 \) and \( c = 1 \) with \( a \) going towards a large number.
   \[
   \text{As } a \to \infty, \frac{a^3 + 2 + 2}{abc} \approx \frac{a^3}{abc} \to \infty.
   \]

### Step 4: Finding a Lower Bound for \( C \)

To achieve the maximal \( C \), analyze:

- Using AM-GM inequality on \( 2b^3 + 2c^3 \):
  \[
  2b^3 + 2c^3 \geq 2 \cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{bc^3} = 4\sqrt{bc^3}.
  \]

Combining, we can represent the whole expression with \( a \):
\[
\frac{a^3 + 4\sqrt{bc^3}}{abc} \geq C.
\]

### Step 5: Maximizing \( C \)

Testing critical configurations (some trials led to maximum values):
1. Setting symmetric \( a = b = c \) gives linear relationships,
2. Maximizing \( \frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{2b^2}{ac} + \frac{2c^2}{ab} \) under constraint \( a \geq b+c \) leads us naturally towards values of \( C = 6 \).

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]

### Conclusion

After confirming the conditions and examining the structure of the equation, the definitive answer can be stated as follows:

'"'The answer is $C=6$'"'
