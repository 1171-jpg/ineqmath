Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{a^3 + 2b^3 + 2c^3}{abc} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \) subject to the condition \( a \geq b + c \).

### Steps to Solve the Problem

**1. Analyze the inequality:**  
We rewrite the left-hand side as:

\[
\frac{a^3}{abc} + \frac{2b^3}{abc} + \frac{2c^3}{abc} = \frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{2b^2}{ac} + \frac{2c^2}{ab}
\]

Thus, we need to ensure that:

\[
\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{2b^2}{ac} + \frac{2c^2}{ab} \geq C 
\]

**2. Set specific values for \( a, b, c \):**  
To understand how the bound behaves, we can test specific values. Let’s choose:

- Set \( b = c = 1 \) and \( a \geq 2 \) (i.e., \( a \) should be at least \( b + c = 2 \)).

Now we compute:

\[
\frac{a^3 + 2(1^3) + 2(1^3)}{a \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = \frac{a^3 + 4}{a} = a^2 + \frac{4}{a} 
\]

**3. Find the minimum value of \( a^2 + \frac{4}{a} \):**  
The function \( f(a) = a^2 + \frac{4}{a} \) requires analysis. We take the derivative:

\[
f'(a) = 2a - \frac{4}{a^2}
\]

Setting the derivative to zero for critical points:

\[
2a = \frac{4}{a^2} \implies 2a^3 = 4 \implies a^3 = 2 \implies a = \sqrt[3]{2}
\]

We need to check if \( \sqrt[3]{2} \) satisfies \( a \geq 2 \). It does not, so we analyze the values at \( a = 2 \).

**4. Evaluate \( f(2) \):**

\[
f(2) = 2^2 + \frac{4}{2} = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

**5. Check inequality at \( a = 2 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 1 \):**  
At this critical configuration, we have:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3 \geq C
\]

Thus, \( C \) must be less than or equal to 6.

**6. Explore further bounds by testing other values:**  
As \( a \) increases indefinitely, \( \frac{4}{a} \) approaches zero, leading to \( a^2 \) as the dominating term, continuously confirming that the minimum bound does not exceed 6 if we were to extend to larger values of \( b \) and \( c \).

### Conclusion

After thorough algebraic checks and scenario evaluations, the largest constant \( C \) that satisfies 

\[
\frac{a^3 + 2b^3 + 2c^3}{abc} \geq C
\] 

under the condition \( a \geq b + c \) is:

\[
C = 6 
\]

Thus, we conclude that 

```
The answer is $C=6$
