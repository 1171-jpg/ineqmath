Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we are tasked with finding the largest constant \( C \) such that the following inequality holds for all non-negative real numbers \( a, b, c \):

\[
\left(a^2+1\right)\left(b^2+1\right)\left(c^2+1\right) \geq (ab+bc+ca-abc)^2 + C \cdot abc
\]

### Step 1: Expand Both Sides
First, expand the left-hand side:

\[
LHS = (a^2 + 1)(b^2 + 1)(c^2 + 1) = a^2b^2c^2 + a^2b^2 + a^2c^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 1
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Right-Hand Side
Next, expand the right-hand side:

1. For the term \( (ab + bc + ca - abc)^2 \):
   \[
   (ab + bc + ca - abc)^2 = (ab + bc + ca)^2 - 2abc(ab + bc + ca) + (abc)^2
   \]
   This expands out to:
   \[
   = a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2a^2 + 2abc(ab + bc + ca) - 2abc(ab + bc + ca) + a^2b^2c^2
   \]
   
2. We also have the \( C \cdot abc \) term.

Combining these, we see that analyzing the terms relative to \( abc \) will be important.

### Step 3: Test Specific Values
Let's test some specific values for \( a, b, c \) to understand the behavior and deduce possible values for \( C \).

#### Case: \( a = b = c = 1 \)

Substituting \( a = b = c = 1 \):

\[
LHS = (1^2 + 1)(1^2 + 1)(1^2 + 1) = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8
\]

\[
(ab + bc + ca - abc)^2 = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1)^2 = 3^2 = 9
\]
Thus,
\[
9 + C \cdot 1 \leq 8 \Rightarrow C \leq -1
\]

#### Case: \( a = b = 1, c = 0 \)

Substituting \( a = b = 1 \) and \( c = 0 \):

\[
LHS = (1^2 + 1)(1^2 + 1)(0^2 + 1) = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 4
\]
\[
(ab + bc + ca - abc)^2 = (1 + 0 + 0 - 0)^2 = 1^2 = 1
\]
Thus,
\[
1 + C \cdot 0 \leq 4 \Rightarrow \text{No restriction for } C.
\]

### Step 4: Conjecture the Largest Constant \( C \)
The constraints gathered suggest:
1. Testing with \( a = b = c = 1 \) led to \( C \leq -1 \).
2. Any non-negative values for \( abc \) are trivial if one variable is zero.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the largest constant \( C \) we find such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c \geq 0 \) is:

\[
\boxed{-1}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
```
The answer is $C=-1$
