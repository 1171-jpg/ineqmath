Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start from the equation given:

\[
(x+1)(y+2) = 8.
\]

### Step 1: Expand the Equation
Expanding the left-hand side gives:

\[
xy + 2x + y + 2 = 8.
\]

Rearranging this, we obtain:

\[
xy + 2x + y = 6.
\]

### Step 2: Express \(xy\)
We want to express \(xy\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\). Rearranging gives:

\[
xy = 6 - 2x - y.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the Original Expression
The original expression to compare is:

\[
|xy - 10|.
\]

Substituting our expression for \(xy\) into this gives:

\[
|6 - 2x - y - 10| = |-2x - y - 4|.
\]

### Step 4: Set Up the Inequality
We need to determine a relation for this expression compared to 7:

\[
|-2x - y - 4| \quad () \quad 7.
\]

### Step 5: Consider Cases for Absolute Value
The expression \( |-2x - y - 4| < 7 \) gives us two inequalities to consider:

\[
-7 < -2x - y - 4 < 7.
\]

Breaking this down we have two inequalities:

1. **First Inequality:**
   \[
   -7 < -2x - y - 4 \implies -3 < -2x - y \implies 2x + y < 3.
   \]

2. **Second Inequality:**
   \[
   -2x - y - 4 < 7 \implies -2x - y < 11 \implies 2x + y > -11.
   \]

### Step 6: Combine the Inequalities
Thus, we conclude:

\[
-11 < 2x + y < 3.
\]

### Step 7: Check \( |xy - 10| \)
Let’s analyze whether \( |xy - 10| \) can ever be \( \geq 7 \). From rearranging the earlier equations, we note:

Since \( (x+1)(y+2) = 8 \) defines a hyperbola in the \(xy\)-plane, we'll look for values satisfying this condition by testing if the resulting \(xy\) from hyperbolic forms can reach \(10\):
- The maximum \(xy\) is constrained to below a certain bound given strictly non-negative products.

### Step 8: Conclusion
After checking our transformations, we see that since the maximum possible distance of \(xy\) from \(10\) based on the equation given does not allow us to reach 7, and using the boundary conditions, we have:

\[
|xy - 10| < 7.
\]

Thus, the correct relation to fill in the blank must be:

\[
\text{(A) }\leq
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\text{'"'The answer is (A) $\leq$'"'}
\]
