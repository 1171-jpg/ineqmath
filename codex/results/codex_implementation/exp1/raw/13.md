## Response

To find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) \geq C
\]

holds for all \( x, y \) satisfying \( x + y = 1 \), let's start working through the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Rewrite the Inequality

The left-hand side can be expanded as follows:

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{xy}
\]

Given \( y = 1 - x \), we can rewrite this as:

\[
= 1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} + \frac{1}{x(1-x)}
\]

### Step 2: Substitute and Simplify

Next, simplifying:

\[
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} = \frac{1 - x + x}{x(1 - x)} = \frac{1}{x(1-x)}
\]

Thus,

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) = 1 + 2\frac{1}{x(1-x)} = 1 + \frac{2}{x(1-x)}
\]

### Step 3: Find the Minimum of the Expression

To find the minimum value of \( 1 + \frac{2}{x(1-x)} \), we need to analyze \( \frac{2}{x(1-x)} \). 

Let \( z = x(1-x) \). The maximum value of \( z \) occurs when \( x = \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
z = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, \( \frac{2}{z} \) attains its minimum value when \( z \) is maximized:

### Step 4: Substitute Back and Compute

When \( z = \frac{1}{4} \):

\[
\frac{2}{z} = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{4}} = 8
\]

Therefore,

\[
1 + \frac{2}{x(1-x)} \geq 1 + 8 = 9
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) \geq C
\]

is 

\[
C = 9.
\]

Putting this in the required format, we have:
