## Response

To solve the inequality involving \(a, b,\) and \(c\), we need to analyze the expression:

\[
S = \frac{a b}{3 a + 4 b + 2 c} + \frac{b c}{3 b + 4 c + 2 a} + \frac{c a}{3 c + 4 a + 2 b}
\]

We aim to show that 

\[
S \quad () \quad \frac{a + b + c}{9}
\]

### Step 1: Understand the structure of the terms

Each term in \(S\) is of the form \( \frac{xy}{Ax + By + Cz} \), where \(x, y, z\) are permutations of \(a, b, c\) and \(A, B, C\) are positive coefficients. This suggests an application of inequalities such as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

### Step 2: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the following form:

\[
\left( \frac{xy}{A_x + B_y + C_z} \right) \leq \frac{x+y+z}{\frac{1}{A} + \frac{1}{B} + \frac{1}{C}}
\]

we can deduce bounds for each term. Specifically for the first term:

\[
\frac{ab}{3a + 4b + 2c} \leq \frac{(a + b)^2}{(3 + 4 + 2)} = \frac{(a + b)^2}{9}
\]

Similar calculations apply for the other two terms in \(S\):

\[
\frac{bc}{3b + 4c + 2a} \leq \frac{(b + c)^2}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{ca}{3c + 4a + 2b} \leq \frac{(c + a)^2}{9}
\]

### Step 3: Summing the inequalities

Adding these inequalities together gives:

\[
S \leq \frac{(a+b)^2}{9} + \frac{(b+c)^2}{9} + \frac{(c+a)^2}{9}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the left side

Expanding the squares:

\[
(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2,
\]
\[
(b+c)^2 = b^2 + 2bc + c^2,
\]
\[
(c+a)^2 = c^2 + 2ca + a^2
\]

The combined expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{9} \left( 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2(ab + bc + ca) \right) = \frac{2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + ab + bc + ca)}{9}
\]

### Step 5: Using the AM-GM Inequality

From the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3}
\]

Therefore,

\[
S \leq \frac{2 \cdot \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3} + 2(ab + bc + ca)}{9}
\]

### Final Analysis

Now, use the identity \(ab + ac + bc \leq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3}\) which leads to:

\[
S \leq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{9}
\]

Combining all results gives:

\[
S \leq \frac{a+b+c}{9}
\]

### Conclusion

This leads us to conclude that:

\[
S \leq \frac{a + b + c}{9}
\]

Hence, the correct option to fill in the blank is:

```
'The answer is (A) $\leq$'
