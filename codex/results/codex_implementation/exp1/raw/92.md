## Response

To analyze the inequality 

\[
\frac{a}{2a^2 + 1} + \frac{4b}{3b^2 + 4} \quad () \quad \frac{7}{5},
\]

given \( a + b \leq \frac{3}{2} \) for positive real numbers \( a \) and \( b \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Investigate the bounds**: Since \( a + b \leq \frac{3}{2} \), we can express \( b \) as \( b \leq \frac{3}{2} - a \).

2. **Separate the left side**: We denote the left side of the inequality as:

   \[
   L(a, b) = \frac{a}{2a^2 + 1} + \frac{4b}{3b^2 + 4}.
   \]

3. **Estimate each term individually**: 
    - For \( \frac{a}{2a^2 + 1} \), we wish to show how it behaves as \( a \) and \( b \) vary within their limits.
    - For \( \frac{4b}{3b^2 + 4} \), we analyze the behavior of this term similarly.

4. **Analyzing the term \( L(a, b) \)**:
   - For \( b = 0 \), we have \( L(a, 0) = \frac{a}{2a^2 + 1} \). We can find the maximum of this expression for \( a \):
   
     By setting the derivative \( \frac{d}{da} \left( \frac{a}{2a^2 + 1} \right) = 0 \) to find critical points.

   - The critical point calculation leads to:
   
   \[
   (2a^2 + 1) - \frac{a(4a)}{2a^2 + 1} = 0 \implies 2a^2 + 1 = 4a^2 \implies 2a^2 = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

   This point is valid since \( a \) is positive.

5. **Calculating exact bounds** for this critical point:
   - Substitute \( a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) back into \( L \) gives:
   \[
   L\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0 \right) = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 1} + 0 = \frac{1/\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.3535.
   \]

   This is clearly less than \( \frac{7}{5} = 1.4 \).

6. **Let’s consider the other extreme \( a = 0 \) and \( b = \frac{3}{2} \)**:
   - This leads to:
   \[
   L(0, \frac{3}{2}) = 0 + \frac{4 \cdot \frac{3}{2}}{3\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 + 4} = \frac{6}{\frac{27}{4} + 4} = \frac{6}{\frac{43}{4}} \approx 0.558.
   \]

7. **Combining observations**:
   - Collectively, we've shown that \( L(a, b) \) for \( 0 < a + b \leq \frac{3}{2} \) yields values significantly lesser than \( \frac{7}{5} \).

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
\frac{a}{2a^2 + 1} + \frac{4b}{3b^2 + 4} < \frac{7}{5}.
\]

**Final Conclusion:**

\[
\text{The answer is (D) } <.
