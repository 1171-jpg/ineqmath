## Response

To solve the inequality problem involving the positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) under the given condition, we start by analyzing the constraint and the inequality.

### Step 1: Analyze the Condition

The condition given is:

\[
\frac{1}{1+a} + \frac{1}{1+b} + \frac{1}{1+c} = 2.
\]

This implies that:

\[
\frac{1}{1+a} = 2 - \left(\frac{1}{1+b} + \frac{1}{1+c}\right).
\]

By manipulating what this implies about \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we begin our analysis.

### Step 2: Use the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We will use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as follows:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{1+a} + \frac{1}{1+b} + \frac{1}{1+c} \right) \left( (1+a) + (1+b) + (1+c) \right) \geq (1 + 1 + 1)^2 = 9.
\]

This means:

\[
2 \cdot (3 + a + b + c) \geq 9.
\]

From this, we can deduce:

\[
3 + a + b + c \geq \frac{9}{2} \implies a + b + c \geq \frac{3}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the Left-Hand Side of the Inequality

Now, we will analyze the left-hand side of the inequality \(2(2ab + 3bc + ca)\). 

Using \(a + b + c \geq \frac{3}{2}\):

- By AM-GM inequality:
\[
ab + bc + ca \leq \frac{(a + b + c)^2}{3}.
\]
However, let's focus on simplifying:

### Step 4: Need a Numerical Example to Verify

Testing specific values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

Let \(a = b = c = 1\).

Now we check if:

\[
\frac{1}{1+1} + \frac{1}{1+1} + \frac{1}{1+1} = \frac{3}{2}.
\]

With \(a = b = c = 1\):

- Calculate \(2(2ab + 3bc + ca)\):
\[
= 2(2(1)(1) + 3(1)(1) + (1)(1)) = 2(2 + 3 + 1) = 12.
\]

- Evaluate \(\sqrt{ab} + \sqrt{bc} + \sqrt{ca}\):
\[
= \sqrt{1} + \sqrt{1} + \sqrt{1} = 3.
\]

### Step 5: Compare to Formulate Inequality

The evaluation gives us:

\[
12 \quad ( ? ) \quad 3
\]

Clearly,

\[
12 \geq 3.
\]

### Step 6: Generalization

To conclude, \(2(2ab + 3bc + ca) \geq \sqrt{ab} + \sqrt{bc} + \sqrt{ca}\) appears to hold.

### Conclusion

Thus, the correct option to fill in the blank is:

```plaintext
'The answer is (B) ≥'
```
