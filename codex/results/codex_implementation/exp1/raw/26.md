## Response

To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{c}{\sqrt{a+b+3c}} + \frac{a}{\sqrt{c+b+3a}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{a+c+3b}} \geq C
\]

holds for all non-negative real numbers \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( ab + ac + bc = 1 \).

### Step 1: Analyzing the Problem
Let’s denote:

\[
S = \frac{c}{\sqrt{a+b+3c}} + \frac{a}{\sqrt{c+b+3a}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{a+c+3b}}
\]

The given condition \( ab + ac + bc = 1 \) implies relationships among \( a, b, c \). Since \( a, b, c \) are non-negative, we can analyze the expression for different specific values of \( a, b, c \).

### Step 2: Setting Specific Values
To simplify our analysis, let’s consider a case where one of the variables is zero. Assume \( c = 0 \), then \( ab = 1 \) implies \( b = \frac{1}{a} \).

Substituting \( c = 0 \) into the inequality gives us:

\[
S = \frac{0}{\sqrt{a + \frac{1}{a} + 0}} + \frac{a}{\sqrt{0 + \frac{1}{a} + 3a}} + \frac{\frac{1}{a}}{\sqrt{a + 0 + 3\frac{1}{a}}}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
S = \frac{a}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{a} + 3a}} + \frac{\frac{1}{a}}{\sqrt{a + 3\frac{1}{a}}}
\]

Let’s compute each term separately.

### Step 3: Evaluating Each Term
1. **First Term:**

   \[
   \frac{a}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{a} + 3a}} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{\frac{1 + 3a^2}{a}}} = \frac{a^{3/2}}{\sqrt{1 + 3a^2}}
   \]

2. **Second Term:**

   \[
   \frac{\frac{1}{a}}{\sqrt{a + 3\frac{1}{a}}} = \frac{1}{a\sqrt{a + \frac{3}{a}}} = \frac{1}{a\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + 3}{a}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3 + a^2}}
   \]

Combining these results, we have:

\[
S = \frac{a^{3/2}}{\sqrt{1 + 3a^2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3 + a^2}}
\]

### Step 4: Finding a Bound for \( S \)
To determine \( C \), consider:

1. As \( a \to 0 \), \( S \to 0 \).
2. As \( a \to 1 \), we simplify to find bounds for \( S \).

### Step 5: Estimating \( S \)
Due to symmetry, we can switch \( a, b, c \) and analyze the behavior of \( S \) when all variables are equal:

Let \( a = b = c \). Then \( 3a^2 = 1 \) implies \( a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \).

Calculating \( S \):

\[
S = 3 \cdot \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + a + 3a}} = 3 \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}{\sqrt{5\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}} = 3 \cdot \frac{1/\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{5/3}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, we can conclude that \( C \) is maximally bounded by \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}} \) for all valid \( a, b, c \). 

Expressing the final result:

```
The answer is $C=\frac{3}{\sqrt{5}}$
