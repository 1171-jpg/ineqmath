## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} \quad () \quad 2 \sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c}.
\]

First, let's denote the cyclic summation over \( a, b, c \) as follows:

1. The left-hand side (LHS):
   \[
   L = \sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}}
   \]

2. The right-hand side (RHS):
   \[
   R = 2 \sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c}
   \]

Now we will evaluate both sides. 

### Step 1: Analyze the Left-Hand Side 

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we can estimate \( L \):
\[
L = \sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}}
\]

Applying Cauchy-Schwarz, we obtain:
\[
L \leq \sqrt{\sum_{cyc} (b+c)^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{cyc} \frac{1}{(a+b)(a+c)}}.
\]

For the sum of squares on the right, we have:
\[
(b+c)^2 = b^2 + c^2 + 2bc.
\]
Thus,
\[
\sum_{cyc} (b+c)^2 = (b^2+c^2 + 2bc) + (c^2+a^2 + 2ca) + (a^2+b^2 + 2ab) = 2(a^2+b^2+c^2 + ab + ac + bc).
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Right-Hand Side 

Now analyze \( R \):
\[
R = 2 \sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c}.
\]
This can also be estimated using Cauchy-Schwarz:
\[
R \geq \frac{(2a + 2b + 2c)^2}{4b + 2c + 4c + 2a + 4a + 2b} = \frac{(2a + 2b + 2c)^2}{6(a + b + c)}.
\]

### Step 3: Comparing \( L \) and \( R \)

Using known inequalities:
- By Nesbitt’s inequality, we know \( \sum_{cyc} \frac{a}{b+c} \geq \frac{3}{2} \), which suggests that \( R \) can be shown to be somewhat larger when \( a, b, c \) are balanced.
- The form \( \sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} \) encourages balance as well.

### Conclusion

Numerically or through inequality testing, we find that:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} \leq 2 \sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c}
\]

This leads us to conclude:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} \leq 2 \sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c}.
\]

Thus, filling in the blank:

**The answer is (A) $\leq$**.
