Suppose \\( C > 64 \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{4}{c} + \\frac{16}{d} \\geq \\frac{C}{a+b+c+d} \\Rightarrow \\left( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{4}{c} + \\frac{16}{d} \\right)(a + b + c + d) \\geq C\n\\]\n\nwhich would contradict our previous deduction from Cauchy-Schwarz when \\( C > 64 \\).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThus, the largest constant \\( C \\) satisfying the inequality is indeed \\( C = 64 \\).\n\nTherefore, we conclude:\n\n```\n'The answer is $C=64$'\n```\n",
