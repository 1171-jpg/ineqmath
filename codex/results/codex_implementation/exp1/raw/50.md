## Response

To solve the given problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

\[
7(ab + bc + ca) \quad () \quad 3 + 9abc
\]

where \(a, b, c \geq 0\) and \(a + b + c = 1\). We will use some algebraic manipulations and properties of non-negative real numbers to find the appropriate relation.

### Step 1: Use Known Inequalities

Given \(a + b + c = 1\), we know from the well-known inequality for non-negative reals:

\[
ab + bc + ca \leq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3} = \frac{1^2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus,

\[
7(ab + bc + ca) \leq 7 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{3}
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Right Side

Now, let’s analyze \(3 + 9abc\). Since \(a, b, c\) are non-negative and \(a + b + c = 1\), the maximum value of \(abc\) occurs when \(a, b, c\) are as equal as possible.

Using the AM-GM inequality:

\[
\frac{a + b + c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies \frac{1}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies abc \leq \frac{1}{27}
\]

Thus,

\[
9abc \leq 9 \times \frac{1}{27} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Adding 3 gives:

\[
3 + 9abc \leq 3 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{10}{3}
\]

### Step 3: Compare the Results

Now, we have:

- \(7(ab + bc + ca) \leq \frac{7}{3}\)
- \(3 + 9abc \leq \frac{10}{3}\)

Next, check if \(\frac{7}{3} \leq \frac{10}{3}\):

\[
\frac{7}{3} < \frac{10}{3}
\]

### Conclusion

Since we have established that:

\[
7(ab + bc + ca) < 3 + 9abc
\]

Thus, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
\boxed{<}
\]

Finally, stating the answer in the requested format, we have:

``'The answer is (D) $<$''`.
