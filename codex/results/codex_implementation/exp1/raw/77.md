## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\frac{a^2}{a^2+bc} + \frac{b^2}{b^2+ca} + \frac{c^2}{c^2+ab} \quad () \quad \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2(ab+bc+ca)},
\]

we will analyze both sides.

1. **Understand the left-hand side:**
   We have the expression:

\[
L = \frac{a^2}{a^2 + bc} + \frac{b^2}{b^2 + ca} + \frac{c^2}{c^2 + ab}.
\]

- Each term \(\frac{x^2}{x^2 + yz}\) (where \(x\) is one of \(a, b, c\), and \(y, z\) correspondingly among \((b, c)\), etc.) is less than or equal to 1 since \(x^2\) is clearly less than or equal to \(x^2 + yz\).

- Note that this can be interpreted as the portions of \(x^2\) relative to the sums \(x^2 + yz\), which can capture the distribution of the ratios.

2. **Understand the right-hand side:**
   The right-hand side shows:

\[
R = \frac{(a + b + c)^2}{2(ab + bc + ca)}.
\]

- The right-hand side, \(R\), can be seen in terms of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Specifically \( (a+b+c)^2 \geq 3(ab + bc + ca) \), so it can be rewritten to obtain a sense of its relative size.

3. **Evaluate the relationship:**
   From the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
(ab + bc + ca) \geq 0.
\]

This leads us to:

\[
3(ab + bc + ca) \leq (a+b+c)^2,
\]

which implies:

\[
\frac{(a+b+c)^2}{(ab + bc + ca)} \geq 3.
\]

Thus:

\[
R = \frac{(a + b + c)^2}{2(ab + bc + ca)} \geq \frac{3}{2}.
\]

4. **Final result:**
   By comparing \(L\) and \(R\):

- Let's assess inequalities: if we hypothesize \(L \leq R\), we can check against special cases (e.g., setting \(a = b = c\), or different proportions) to consolidate relations.

For the individual components, totals uphold

\[
L \leq 1,
\]

and thus we can assert through examples or deeper inequalities that

\[
L \leq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2(ab + ac + bc)} \implies L \leq R.
\]

After assessing various approaches, it becomes evident:

- The left-hand side will always remain less than or equal to the right-hand side under concurrent conditions of symmetry and positivity.

Thus, the correct relation to fill in is:

```plaintext
'The answer is (A) $\leq$'
