## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\frac{a^2}{a^2+bc} + \frac{b^2}{b^2+ca} + \frac{c^2}{c^2+ab} \quad () \quad \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2(ab+bc+ca)},
\]

let's analyze both sides step by step.

### Step 1: Simplifying the Left Side

The left side of the inequality consists of three fractions. We know the general behavior of these types of inequalities involves homogenous expressions in symmetric sums. Each term \(\frac{a^2}{a^2+bc}\) can be rewritten in a way to analyze its contribution.

We rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\frac{a^2}{a^2 + bc} = 1 - \frac{bc}{a^2 + bc}.
\]

Thus, summing yields:

\[
\frac{a^2}{a^2 + bc} + \frac{b^2}{b^2 + ca} + \frac{c^2}{c^2 + ab} = 3 - \left( \frac{bc}{a^2 + bc} + \frac{ca}{b^2 + ca} + \frac{ab}{c^2 + ab} \right).
\]

### Step 2: Estimating Each Component

Each fraction in the sum contributes less than or equal to 1:

\[
\frac{bc}{a^2 + bc} \leq \frac{bc}{bc} = 1.
\]

This implies that 

\[
\frac{bc}{a^2 + bc} + \frac{ca}{b^2 + ca} + \frac{ab}{c^2 + ab} \geq 0.
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{a^2}{a^2 + bc} + \frac{b^2}{b^2 + ca} + \frac{c^2}{c^2 + ab} < 3.
\]

### Step 3: Comparing to the Right Side

Now, focus on the right side 

\[
\frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2(ab+bc+ca)}.
\]
Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[
(a+b+c)^2 \leq 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2),
\]
and

\[
ab + bc + ca \leq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3}.
\]

This implies from the Rearrangement or Muirhead inequalities that for positive \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
\frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2(ab+bc+ca)} \geq 1.
\]

### Final Comparison

To summarize:

- The left side was shown to be less than \(3\),
- The right side is greater than or equal to 1.

Now we need to determine the accurate relationship between the two sides:

We find:

\[
\frac{a^2}{a^2 + bc} + \frac{b^2}{b^2 + ca} + \frac{c^2}{c^2 + ab} \leq 1,
\]

has a conclusion tendency towards \( \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2(ab+bc+ca)} \geq 1.\)

Thus, combining everything indicates that:

\[
\frac{a^2}{a^2 + bc} + \frac{b^2}{b^2 + ca} + \frac{c^2}{c^2 + ab} \leq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2(ab+bc+ca)}.
\]

### Conclusion

Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:

```plaintext
'The answer is (A) $\leq$'
```
