Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given conditions:

1. \( a, b, c > 0 \)
2. \( a + b + c = 2 \)
3. \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2 \)

From the second condition, we derive:

\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc)
\]

Substituting the conditions:

\[
2^2 = 2 + 2(ab + ac + bc)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4 = 2 + 2(ab + ac + bc)
\]
\[
2 = 2(ab + ac + bc)
\]
\[
ab + ac + bc = 1
\]

### Step 1: Express \( abc \) in terms of \( a, b, c \)

Using the identity for the product of any three positive numbers under their sum and sum of squares, we apply the method of Lagrange multipliers or AM-GM inequality to find bounds for \( abc \).

### Step 2: Use constraints to derive \( C \)

From the equations \( a + b + c = 2 \) and \( ab + ac + bc = 1 \), we will consider the scenario when \( a, b, c \) are close to being equal due to the symmetry of the problem.

Assuming \( a = b = c \), let:

\[
x = a = b = c
\]

Then:

\[
3x = 2 \implies x = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can calculate \( abc \):

\[
abc = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{27}
\]

### Step 3: Check if this is maximum

Since we derived the sum of variables and the sum of squares with two back-to-back equalities leading us to equal variables, we check if any configuration or distribution of values deviating from this equality minimizes \( abc \).

### Step 4: Verify extremes

To further investigate, let’s check the scenario where two values are significantly smaller than the third. Without loss of generality, let \( a \) be significantly smaller, and \( b = c \).

Let \( b = c \) such that:

\[
a + 2b = 2 \implies a = 2 - 2b
\]

Substituting into the second equation:

\[
(2-2b)^2 + 2b^2 = 2 \implies 4 - 8b + 4b^2 + 2b^2 = 2 \implies 6b^2 - 8b + 2 = 0
\]

This quadratic gives us:

\[
b = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 2}}{2 \cdot 6} = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 48}}{12} = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{16}}{12} = \frac{8 \pm 4}{12}
\]

Thus:

\[
b = 1 \text{ (yielding } a = 0) \text{ or } b = \frac{2}{3}
\]

### Conclusion

The maximum achievable \( abc \) when maximizing subject to the limits given produces that:

\[
\max(abc) = \frac{8}{27}
\]

Hence, the minimal constant \( C \) such that \( abc \leq C \) is:

\[
\boxed{C = \frac{8}{27}}
\]

Therefore, we conclude:

```plaintext
The answer is $C=\frac{8}{27}$
```
