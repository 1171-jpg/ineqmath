## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\sum \frac{a(a^3+1)}{3b+c} \quad () \quad 2a^3 + b^3 + c^3
\]

given that \( abc = 1 \), we will analyze both sides step-by-step.

### Rearranging the Sum

First, let's rewrite the left-hand side:

\[
\sum \frac{a(a^3 + 1)}{3b + c} = \sum \frac{a^4}{3b + c} + \sum \frac{a}{3b + c}
\]

### Applying AM-GM Inequality

Using the properties of symmetric sums and the AM-GM inequality, we can analyze the right side:

\[
2a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \quad \text{and applying the AM-GM inequality, we have:}
\]

\[
\frac{2a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{3} \geq (2a^3 \cdot b^3 \cdot c^3)^{1/3}
\]

Since \( bc = \frac{1}{a} \) (and similar for others), we know that:

\[
(2a^3 \cdot \frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{a})^{1/3} \to \frac{2(abc)^{3/5}}{a^{2/5}} = 2
\]

### Finding a Relation

Now let's analyse the parts of the inequality:

1. **Left Side:**
   \[
   \sum \frac{a(a^3+1)}{3b+c}
   \]

   We can deduce this portion augmented with \( abc=1 \) constraints. 

2. **Right Side:**
   Let's assume a simple case where \( a = b = c = 1 \):

   Evaluating:
   \[
   2(1)^3 + (1)^3 + (1)^3 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
   \]

### Testing with Specific Values

With \( a = b = c = 1 \):
\[
\sum \frac{1(1^3 + 1)}{3 \cdot 1 + 1} = \sum \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

The values suggest \( \frac{3}{2} \) is significantly less than \( 4 \).

### Approach with Cauchy-Schwarz

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
\[
\sum \frac{a(a^3+1)}{3b+c} \geq \frac{(a + a^3 + b + c)^2}{3} 
\]

### Conclusion

From numerical evidence and symmetry in the arrangement, we see that 

\[
\sum \frac{a(a^3+1)}{3b+c} < 2a^3 + b^3 + c^3
\]

For given \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) satisfying the product constraints. We suspect that this will hold in general due to the constraint \( abc = 1 \) favoring symmetrically smaller configurations.

Thus, the fulfilling inequality is:
